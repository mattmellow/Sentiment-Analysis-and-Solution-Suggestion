      "- I'm so excited at what Samsung did this year. After they didn't release an FE version of the Tab S8, they released not one but two FE versions of the newer Tab S9 lineup. So let's talk about how they compare, the interesting differences in battery life, whether either one of these is actually worth getting. And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. So overall, these are two very similar tablets, and one of the most important differences is size. The Tab S9 FE is smaller with a 10.9 inch display, the FE+ comes with a larger 12.4 inch display, so naturally, it's larger and heavier, but it's not any thicker. The two tablets have a similar design with a full aluminum frame and back, and I love that Samsung was able to bring IP68 rating down to the FE version, giving both tablets protection from water and dust. Now this is great if you take your tablet with you to work or when you travel, but it's also a super nice feature if you're using it around the house and you have a dog that likes to throw toys up in the air and also has a super aggressive tail. Now both tablets offer face recognition for biometric authentication, and a more secure fingerprint sensor, which is integrated into the power button. Now the fingerprint sensor on the FE models has worked great for me, but it's just a little less convenient than the under-display sensor on the flagship models. Both tablets also have a microSD card slot, so we can upgrade the internal storage by up to one terabyte, and we can use that storage for photos, for videos, for files, and for most apps. Now continuing to look around the edges, we're getting two AKG-tuned speakers on both tablets. And while the flagship models come with four speakers and sound fuller, the FE models are not too shabby if you're someone who actually uses the speakers on their tablet. Now going back to the display, both tablets have an IPS LCD display, which offers a 90 hertz adaptive refresh rate. The FE model has a low resolution but a slightly higher pixel density. And realistically, you aren't really going to notice that difference in terms of sharpness. Now I like the higher resolution and the larger display on the FE+ because I'm able to see more without having to scroll and it's better for multitasking. But of course, you're giving up on portability and there are also some implications in terms of gaming, which we'll talk about later on. Now both tablets have an aspect ratio of 16:10, so they're excellent for watching content. And in terms of image quality, both are very good for LCD displays. And if you're looking for an even better display, you can check out the Tab S8+ or the Tab S8 Ultra with their dynamic AMOLED display, or jump to the current flagship Tab S9 models with their dynamic AMOLED 2X displays. Now when it comes to gaming, it's important to consider the fact that these are not flagship models. So part of what you're giving up is performance. I was able to play my usual games like \"Genshin,\" \"Asphalt,\" \"PUBG,\" and then, of course, some less demanding games, but there's an obvious difference in both processing power and GPU performance when compared with the flagship models, and it did have an impact on more resource-intensive games. The two FE models performed about the same, and we'll quickly go over benchmarks in the Performance section, but there's no question that Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip in the flagship models is more capable than the Exynos 1380 in the FE versions. Using \"PUBG\" as an example, with the FE model, I was limited to high frame rate whether Graphics were set to Smooth, Balanced, or HD, and that was as good as it got. So I definitely couldn't get to 90 FPS. With the flagship models, gameplay was smoother and more responsive, and I could play with Graphics set to Smooth and Frame Rate set to 90 FPS. I could also set Graphics anywhere from Balanced to HDR and Frame Rate to Extreme, or ultra HD for Graphics and Ultra for Frame Rate. While playing \"Genshin Impact,\" I had a very similar experience where it was playable on the FE models, but it was much more fluid and less laggy on the flagship models. Again, because of the more capable processor and the additional RAM. Now the FE+ model does come with either two or four more gigs of RAM than the FE model. Depending on which storage option we're comparing in, we'll cover that in the Configuration section. Either way, if more demanding games are a priority for you, then keep in mind that we know game developers are always going to push to CPU and GPU, and games are going to evolve and start to demand more and more resources. When I look to keep a device for at least four to five years, I'm always going to opt for the tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance than I need right now. And that way, I know that it'll continue to perform better in the future. Something else to consider is the size of the display. The FE+ is bigger, so it's easier to see someone sniping at you from a distance, but the FE model is smaller and lighter so it's more comfortable to hold and play for longer periods of time. If you wanna stream and play Xbox games with the Xbox Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox controller with both tablets and have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection. I would give the edge to the FE+ model because of the larger display. And both tablets started with 120 gigabytes of storage and have a 256 gigabyte model. So there's no advantage in terms of space for games. And remember that you can use the microSD for additional inexpensive storage, which is a great deal. And speaking of that, if you're looking for great deals on new tech, check out today's sponsor, Best Buy, where you can get a 512 gigabyte Samsung Pro Plus microSD card for 40 bucks.

So if you wanna save some money on a gift or something for yourself, make sure to download the Best Buy app now for great deals, and think you to Best Buy for sponsoring this portion of the video. Now back to the tablets, another factor to consider is the ability to expand the functionality of each tablet by adding a keyboard case and a stylus. Now both tablets are compatible with two versions of the Book Cover Keyboard from Samsung. In that context, I prefer the FE+ because it's larger and more comfortable to type on. And of course, you can always use an external Bluetooth keyboard instead. Now both tablets also come with a free S Pen, which can be stored on the side or on the back of the tablet, but these are not Bluetooth-enabled S Pens like the ones that come with the flagship models. In terms of the actual writing experience, it's going to be the same with both tablets. And the only practical difference here is the larger canvas on the FE+ model. Looking at the camera systems, both have an eight megapixel rear-facing camera and a 12 megapixel selfie camera. So here's a quick sample. Here's a camera and microphone test of the Tab S9 FE and the Tab S9 FE+. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect from both tablets. We talked about performance in the Gaming section, so let's quickly look at the single and multi-core performance of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and the Exynos 138 so you can see the differences between the FE and the flagship models. We also see a significant difference in GPU performance, which helps explain some of the differences we saw when gaming. This is not to say that the FE models are not a good value. If you're surfing the web, watching video, or going on social media, you'll definitely be able to use these tablets. And even for like gaming or for and other typical tasks, these will work great. Of course, for more demanding things like photo and video editing or for more demanding games, the flagship models are more capable, but I always encourage you to keep in mind what you plan on doing and not buy products based on somebody else's needs. Both tablets run the latest Android and One UI, so you're getting all the latest features like three tiled apps, pop-up windows, and then of course DeX, which is awesome. So essentially, it reboots the tablet and gives you an operating system that is very similar to a desktop OS. You're getting a task bar, a desktop with icons, multiple windows, you can snap windows, and you can use a keyboard case to transform your tablet to more of a laptop replacement. You can also connect an external keyboard and mouse for a better user experience, but you can't connect an external display and run a dual display setup with either the FE or the FE+. That's only available on the flagship models. You can, however, use both of these tablets as an additional display for your laptop or desktop with Samsung's Second Screen. This is a super handy feature when you travel. As far as OS and security updates, Samsung promises four years of OS updates and five years of security updates, which I think is great. In terms of battery life, the FE model has a smaller 8,000 milliamp per hour battery versus 10,090 on the FE+, and I was super curious to know how that would play out considering the differences in the display sizes. In my test, I found that the larger battery on the FE+ lasts longer even though it has to power the bigger display. And if you want more information, check out this detailed battery drain test of the entire Tab S9 lineup. Now both tablets offer 45 watt fast charging, but neither ships with an adapter, so that's something that you're gonna need to purchase separately. Now when we look at configuration options, both start out with 120 gigabytes of internal storage. The Tab S9 FE comes with six gigs of RAM, and the FE+ comes with eight gigs of RAM. If we upgrade to 256 gigabytes on both models, then we're getting eight gigs of RAM on the Tab S9 FE, and then 12 on the FE+. Now, I didn't notice a major difference in performance between the two of them, but of course, all other things being equal, having more RAM is better, especially if you're multitasking. So ultimately, the choice comes down to the smaller, less expensive, and more portable Tab S9 FE versus the FE+, which has a larger display, is better for multitasking, has more RAM, and better battery life. Now you should check out the battery drain test. Hopefully, this comparison was helpful. Click on my face to subscribe. You know what I always say, \"Buy it nice or buy it twice.\" Good luck and see you soon.- When Samsung released the FE version of the Tab S9, I was so excited and I couldn't wait to do this comparison with the iPad 10. Both tablets are about the same size and the same price, but the choice wasn't as easy as I initially thought it would be. And by the way, I know prices around the world are very different, so if you're watching this from outside of the US, please let me know in the comment section where you're from and how much each of these tablets cost because obviously this is a really important factor and thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. So the first thing most people consider is the display. And in this case, the iPad 10 has a 10.9 inch liquid retina 60 Hertz display with the resolution of 1640 by 2360, a four by three aspect ratio and 264 pixels per inch. The Tab S9 FE also has a 10.9 inch IPS LCD display, but it's a 90 Hertz display, has a resolution of 1440 by 2304, an aspect ratio of 16 by 10 and then a lower pixel density of 249. Now in terms of image quality, both displays are sharp and crisp, and if I'm being critical, the iPad has better color accuracy and the Tab S9 FE is a bit warmer and has a slight greenish shift. I do like that it's a 90 Hertz display on the Tab S9 FE because things like animations and scrolling look smoother. Now, 60 Hertz has never really been a deal breaker for me. Right now I'm using three different phones, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Samsung S23 Ultra and the Pixel 8 Pro. So I'm used to 120 Hertz, but I think a higher refresh rate is a nice to have, but not critical for most tasks on mobile devices. There are exceptions, of course, like some games, but things got a little strange there. So I'll come back to that in the dedicated gaming section of this video. Now, in terms of aspect ratio, the Tab S9 FE is better suited for watching video because the 16 by 10 aspect ratio is closer to most content and the image is larger and has smaller black bars. Now with the iPad 10, we're getting a four by three aspect ratio, which is wider in portrait mode, and it's really nice when taking handwritten notes using the Apple Pencil. Now another important difference is that the Tab S9 FE has a fully laminated display. So the display, the touch layer and the cover glass are fused together into a single display assembly and the image looks like it's printed right on top of the glass. On the iPad 10, there is an air gap between the display and the combination of cover glass and touch layer. For a lot of things like watching movies, surfing the web or playing games, it's not really something that you're going to notice unless you really look for it, but when you're using the stylus, it does make a difference. So with the iPad 10, you'll be able to see separation between the tip of the Apple Pencil and the content that's being created, especially if you're looking at an angle. With the Tab S9 FE because the image looks like it's on top of the glass, it's going to look like the tip of the S Pen is touching the line or the content that you're creating, which of course is better. The one advantage of a non laminated display is that if the display gets damaged, most of the time it's just a cover glass so replacement is relatively inexpensive. With a fully laminated display, the entire display assembly has to be replaced even if you just scratch the cover glass. I'll also get to a few other important stylus differences in just a moment, but first I want to talk about gaming. So I play a lot of games on my tablets and I was really curious to see how these two would match up. So I was able to play my usual games like Genshin, Asphalt and PUBG and then of course less demanding games. But there was an obvious difference in both processing power and GPU performance, which did have an impact on more resource intensive games. I'll quickly show you benchmarks in the performance section, but this was one of those areas where I could clearly see the advantage of the iPad's A14 chip over the Exynos 1380. Now using PUBG as an example, gameplay was smoother and more responsive on the iPad, and I could play with balanced graphics and extreme frame rate versus balanced graphics and high frame rate on the Tab S9. And then of course, I could definitely not get to the 90 FPS that would take advantage of the faster refresh rate on the Samsung display. I had a similar experience with Genshin, which again performed better on the iPad 10, even though it has less RAM than a Tab S9 FE. Now looking ahead, we know that game developers are always looking to push the CPU and GPU and games are going to evolve and start to demand more and more resources. If I'm looking for a device to keep for the next four or five years or even more, I'm always going to opt for the tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance than what I need right now so it continues to perform well into the future. Now, if you wanna stream and play Xbox Games with the Xbox Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox controller with both tablets and have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection. But there's one area where the Tab S9 FE comes out ahead and that's storage. The iPad 10 starts out with 64 gigabytes of internal storage versus 128 gigs on the Tab S9 FE. To give you a sense of what that means, iPad OS currently takes up a little over 10 gigabytes of storage, system data takes up another 11 gigs, and PUBG uses a little over 20 gigs. So that's 41 out of 64 available gigabytes already used up with no other apps, files or photos. Now both tablets are also available in 256 gigabyte options. With the iPad, that's an additional 150 bucks, and with the Tab S9 FE, it's an extra 70 bucks. Now the Tab S9 FE also has a micro SD card slot, which you can use to expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. And you can use this storage for files, photos, videos, and for most apps. We'll talk more about the configuration options later on but for right now, I just wanna make sure that you have enough storage for all the apps and the games that you want to install. And that brings me to today's sponsor Best Buy and the Western Digital Storage Solutions for gamers. If you have a PlayStation 5, the Western Digital Black SN850 P NVME SSD is officially licensed.

Both tablets are machined aluminum, both have rounded corners and squared off edges, but the Tab S9 FE has slightly smaller bezels. We're getting a fingerprint sensor incorporated into the power button in both devices, on the iPad 10 it's on the short side, on the Tab S9 FE it's on the longer side, and both have been very accurate and responsive for me, but the iPad 10 has four speaker grills versus two on the Tab S9 FE, but both tablets only have two speakers, one on each side. In terms of audio quality, both are good but not as good as the higher end models. And the Tab S9 FE speakers are a tad louder and sound a bit brighter. One thing that I found when I'm gaming and holding the tablet in my hand is that on the iPad Air 4, I'm actually covering the speakers with my hand. So there are two other grills, so the sound can't come from there. But on the Tab S9 FE, the speakers are on the top if I'm holding in a landscape mode, so I'm not blocking them. Now personally, I'm okay either way because whenever I'm gaming, I'm wearing a headset, but I just wanted to mention it in case you don't. The Tab S9 FE also has an IP 68 rating, so we're getting protection from water and dust. Now, obviously this is important if you take your tablet with you and you travel or when you go outside, but even when you're just around the house, it's nice to have additional protection from accidental spills. Now, both tablets use a USB-C port for charging and connecting accessories, which brings me to the stylus and keyboard options. The iPad 10 is compatible with the first generation Apple Pencil, which costs $99. It pairs and charges using a cable, and it requires a USB to lightning adapter. The iPad is also compatible with the newer USB-C Apple Pencil, which charges and pairs with a wire but doesn't require an adapter. It costs $79. It doesn't offer pressure sensitivity, but it does magnetically attach to the side of the iPad. The Tab S9 FE comes with a free S Pen, which can be stored on the side or on the back of the tablet. It has a programmable button and it doesn't need to be charged in order to write or draw. Now, in terms of the actual writing experience, the Apple Pencil has a firm tip, so it's a little harsher when it hits the glass and it feels like you're writing on a single sheet of paper that's placed on a hard surface. The S Pen has a softer tip to it, so when it hits the glass, it gives a little, and it feels more like you're writing on a full pad of paper where the pages compress as you press down. Now, one isn't objectively better than the other for every single use and it's going to come down to which one feels better for you. So as always, I hope this description helps you make a choice. Now, as far as the camera systems, the iPad has a more capable rear facing camera in terms of resolution and frame rate, and both tablets have a 12 megapixel front facing camera. And here's a quick sample. Here's a camera and microphone test of the iPad 10 and the Tab S9 FE. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect from each tablet. Now, both tablets also have the front facing camera on the long edge, so you're always properly framed during video calls. Now, when we talked about gaming, I mentioned the performance of the iPad's A14 Bionic, and the Tab S9 FE's Exynos 1380. So let's quickly look at single and multi-core performance where we see the Apple chip pull ahead. We also see it's scored noticeably higher in GPU performance, which helps explain some of the differences we saw. Now, of course, these are just benchmark scores. So what about just typical real life use? Well, if you're surfing the web, watching video or going on social media, it doesn't really matter that much. You can easily do that with both tablets, but the iPad does feel snappier and more responsive, and I would expect it to continue to perform better for longer. Now, if you're doing something like a very heavy video editing, then again the iPad would be a better choice. When multitasking, the iPad can run two apps in split view, plus additional apps in a slide over window. The Tab S9 FE can run three tiled apps at the same time with more flexibility when it comes to how much real estate each app takes. It can also run multiple floating windows, which can be resized, and you can even change the transparency. Now, both tablets have a customizable dock, but the Tab S9 FE also has a super handy side panel for quick access. Now, both tablets can be used as additional displays for compatible desktops and laptops. Apple calls this feature sidecar and Samsung calls it second screen. These are great features and you should all use them, but if you're looking for more of a laptop replacement, the Tab S9 FE has DeX, which I love, but there is one limitation here. So if you're new to Samsung, DeX essentially reboots the tablet with an OS that looks very similar to what you get on a laptop. You've got a task bar where you can minimize and see active apps. You have an actual desktop with icons, and you can run multiple floating windows or snap windows to the side of the display. But unlike with the higher end Tab S9, S9+ and S9 Ultra, you can't connect an external monitor and run a dual display setup. The iPad 10 does let you mirror your display to an external display, but it doesn't stretch out to fill the entire monitor because the iPad 10 doesn't fully support stage manager, and it's not an extended display. So when it comes to being a laptop replacement, it's still a win for the Tab S9 FE, but not quite as good as what you get with the higher end models. Now, battery life is always interesting because it comes down to what you actually do. So comparing these devices when they're new, I'm looking at about 10 hours on the iPad 10, about 13 to 14 hours on a Tab S9 FE. Again, depending on what I was doing. Now, of course, these times are not of me gaming the entire time, and they include things like surfing the web, watching video, using social media apps, and working with productivity apps. Now, when you're looking at available apps, the Google Play Store, the Galaxy Store and the Apple App Store have a ton of options for pretty much everything that you need. In general, I'm going to give the edge to the iPad 10 because the apps seem to be better optimized for a tablet. But as I've said in recent videos, the gap continues to shrink. Several creative apps like Affinity Photo and Procreate are only available for the iPad, but it's great to see that there's an Android version of Luma Fusion. Now, both tablets run the latest available operating systems and Samsung promises four years of OS upgrades and five years of security updates. Now, Apple devices typically get longer support than that. So when I take into account the improved CPU and GPU performance, I'm going to give the iPad the edge in terms of longevity. I also want you to consider other products that you own which make up your ecosystem. Now, Samsung has made some really impressive improvements over the past few years, adding much needed integration between multiple devices, wireless file and text sharing, then additional cross device integrations. And even though the gap again continues to shrink, Apple's ecosystem is still more complete and more tightly integrated due to the fact that they have full control over the hardware and software on all of their devices. Now, when we look at configuration options and prices from the official stores, we already talked about the storage options, but both the 64 and 256 gigabyte models of the iPad 10 come with four gigabytes of RAM. with the Tab S9 FE, the 128 gigabyte model comes with six gigs of RAM and the 256 gigabyte model comes with eight. So here's how I look at this choice. The iPad is more powerful and will be more capable if you plan on keeping your device for many years and you like to play more demanding games at higher settings or performing other resource intensive tasks. It also offers better optimized apps, access to some creative specific apps and better longterm support. The Tab S9 FE is smaller and lighter. It offers additional protection with an IP 68 rating. It comes with a free S Pen, more storage, expandable storage, more capable multitasking, and better battery life. Now, you should see how the Tab S9 Ultra compares with the previous model. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.Just like the iPad Pro, Samsung's flagship Tab S9 isn't made to appeal to the masses with its premium price, no doubt it offers a really good screen and performance, you sometimes just want a good looking tablet that doesn't feel too expensive but also serviceable at the same time, this is where the Galaxy Tab S9 FE fills in the gap, it looks pretty with a very similar aluminum build and design, and it costs almost half the price of the Tab S9 for the same amount of storage, which is really insane. So, after using it for two weeks, I have some thoughts and here's my review. Compared to the Tab S9, the Tab S9 FE has a slightly smaller screen at 10.9-inches and the bezels are slightly thicker, which gives it around the same dimensions and meanwhile, it is also thicker and heavier but despite that, I still find it very manageable even after holding for 30 minutes. The 10.9-inch display is a 1440p IPS LCD panel that refreshes at 90Hz, which is an improvement over what's offered on the Tab S7 FE previously, and though it lacks the color punch you get on an AMOLED display, it still looks decent for content consumption, not to mention the dual stereo speakers tuned by AKG with Dolby Atmos support, they sound pretty good and I daresay it is on par with the M1 iPad Air. The tablet features a fingerprint reader that's built into the power button, which I very much prefer to under display ones, it has pogo pins at the bottom to power the same book keyboard cover as the Tab S9, which I'm unfortunately not provided with the review unit, but it does come with a non-battery powered S Pen which can be attached magnetically to the top or back of the tablet, and speaking of the S Pen, I love how responsive and precise it is for scribbling on the tablet which is all thanks to the 90Hz display, if you intend to do art on it, Samsung does sell a Creator Edition S Pen that works with the tablet and has better precision. What really amazes me about the Tab S9 FE is the IP68 water and dust resistance that no other similar class tablets are offering at this time, though to be honest I don't see any real world use case for now and this will probably appeal to those who watches Netflix by the pool or in a bathtub, even the provided S Pen is IP68 water and dust resistant, which is really unexpected, but it’s a good thing that Samsung didn't leave out such durability on a cheaper device. The Tab S9 FE is powered by the Exynos 1380 SoC that also powers the Galaxy A54 5G, you also get 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of expandable storage, the former is a big step down from the Galaxy Tab S9 but unless you want to push the graphics quality in games, the Tab S9 FE actually performs pretty well as a productivity tablet, I encountered very minor stutters in switching apps and scrolling that I would say it is totally negligible, I'm very impressed with how optimized the UI is but as usual, most Android apps are still terrible at supporting tablet screens, Samsung DeX is available on the Tab S9 FE if you prefer a PC desktop like experience, but you can't expand the tablet's display to an external monitor because the USB-C port doesn't support display output and only has USB 2.0 transfer speeds, this isn't going to be a big deal for most people but I think it is something that Samsung should have included as it did on the older Tab S7 FE. The cameras on the tablet are very serviceable, you get a single 12MP camera on the back and an 8MP camera on the front, thought don't expect them to be as good as a phone camera but at least if you want to take some casual photos on it, they are really good for tablet standards, they both also support video recording at 4K 30fps, but I'm not sure why my unit's main camera is limited to just 1080p for whatever reasons, let me know in the comments if you faced the same thing on your unit. The Galaxy Tab S9 FE have no problems lasting up to two days if you are daily driving it as a productivity tablet, but I realized that standby times aren't that great as the battery can totally be depleted in 4 days if you aren't doing anything on it, although the saving grace here is Samsung's 45W fast charging, which can juice up a dead battery in 90 minutes and overall, I have no major complains about it. In my opinion, I think this is the most sensible FE product that Samsung has ever made, mainly because there isn't a lot of competition in the Android tablet market, and there is a clear price difference between the flagship Tab S9, the Tab S9 FE is obviously targeted at Apple's entry-level iPad and the M1 iPad Air, and I think it serves a great value proposition over these two when it comes to the hardware features, but definitely not when it comes to performance and the quality of apps you get on iPadOS, but even so, I think this is a better value tablet for media consumption and basic productivity due to its 16:10 aspect ratio that works really well.- As soon as we compare these two displays, we immediately see some super important differences. You see, there are times where you can get a better value by spending less money, but there are also times when spending more is actually worth it. So when Samsung released the FE or Fan Edition version of the Tab S9, I was super curious to see if it's a better value than the flagship version or if more is actually more. And to be clear, there's a massive price difference right now with the FE version being half the price of the flagship model. Now, starting out with the displays, they're very close in terms of size, they have the same aspect ratio. You have 16 by 10, which makes them great for watching content. But in terms of specs, that's pretty much where the similarities end. The Tab S9 has an 11 inch dynamic AMOLED 2X display, which offers 120 hertz adaptive refresh rate, a resolution of 1600 by 2560, and a pixel density of 274 pixels per inch. The Tab S9 FE has a 10.9 inch IPS LCD display, which offers a slower 90 hertz adaptive refresh rate, a lower resolution of 1440 by 2304, and a lower pixel density of 249 pixels per inch. In terms of image quality, the FE display is actually quite good and I'm super happy with the image quality for watching video and for playing games. I also love that we're getting 90 hertz versus the 50 hertz we got on the Tab S7 FE. But there's no question that the dynamic AMOLED 2X display on the flagship model is the better display. Colors seem to pop off the screen, we're getting outstanding blacks, better contrast, and the UI animations look smoother. Overall, I'm clearly going to give the edge to the Tab S9, but it's definitely not twice as good as a Tab S9 FE. The two tablets have a similar design with a full aluminum frame and back. They have the same footprint, but the Tab S9 is a bit thinner. I do love that Samsung was able to bring the IP68 rating down to the FE version, giving both tablets protection from water and dust. This is great if you take your tablet with you to work or school or when you travel, but it's also a super nice feature if you're using it around the house and you have a dog with an aggressive tail. Now, both tablets offer face recognition for biometric authentication and a more secure fingerprint sensor. With the Tab S9, we're getting an under display fingerprint sensor and with the FE, it's integrated into the power button. Both sensors have worked great for me and are super responsive and accurate, but I prefer the under display version on the Tab S9 because it's more natural to how I hold the tablet. And both tablets have a micro SD card slot, so we can upgrade the internal storage by up to one terabyte and we can use that internal storage for photos, videos, files, and for most apps. Now, continuing to look around the edges, we're getting four AKG tuned speakers on the Tab S9 versus two on the FE. And the flagship model definitely has a more full sound. The audio seems warmer and has more presence to it, which makes it a better choice for watching content. Another area where I noticed a difference is gaming. Now, I play a lot on my tablets and I was really curious to see how these processors match up. So I was able to play my usual games like Genshin, Asphalt, and PUBG, and of course some less demanding games on both tablets, but there was an obvious difference in both processing power and GPU performance, which did have an impact on more resource-intensive games. We'll quickly go over benchmarks in the performance section, but there's no question that Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip in the Tab S9 is more capable than the Exynos 1380 in the FE version. Using PUBG as an example, gameplay was smoother and more responsive on the Tab S9 and I could play with graphics set to smooth and frame rate set to 90 FPS. I could also set graphics anywhere from balanced to HDR and frame rate set to extreme or ultra HD for graphics and ultra for frame rate. With the FE model, I was limited to high frame rate, whether graphics were set to smooth, balanced or HD, and that was as good as it got so I definitely couldn't get to 90 FPS. Playing Genshin Impact, I had a very similar experience where it was playable on both devices, but performed better on the Tab S9, again, because of the more capable processor and the additional RAM, which I'll discuss in a bit. If gaming is a priority for you, then looking ahead, we know that game developers are going to push the CPU and GPU and games are going to evolve and start to demand more and more resources. When I look to keep a device for at least four or five years, I'm always going to opt for the tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance than I need right now so that it continues to perform well in the future. Now, if you wanna stream and play Xbox Games with the Xbox Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox controller with both tablets and have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection. Now, both tablets start out with 120 gigabytes of storage and have a 256 gigabyte model. So there's no advantage in terms of space for games and you can't really go wrong here.

And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this portion of the video. Now, back to the tablets. Another factor to consider is the ability to expand the functionality of each tablet by adding a keyboard case and a stylus. Now, both tablets are compatible with the same two versions of book cover keyboard from Samsung. And of course, you can always use an external Bluetooth keyboard instead. Now, both tablets also come with a free S Pen, which can be stored on the side or on the back of the tablet, but only the Tab S9 has a Bluetooth enabled S Pen, which offers some wireless functionality for things like camera control and media playback. Now, in terms of the actual writing experience, it's virtually identical and neither requires a charge in order to write or draw. Looking at the camera systems, the Tab S9 has the 13 megapixel rear facing camera versus 8 megapixel on the Tab S9. Both tablets have a 12 megapixel selfie camera. And here's a quick sample. This is a camera and microphone test of the Tab S9 and the Tab S9 Fe. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect for video calls. Now, I briefly mentioned performance when we talked about gaming. So let's quickly look at the single and multi-core performance of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and the Exynos 1380, where we see the Snapdragon chip pull way ahead. We also see it score considerably higher in GPU performance, which helps explain some of the differences we saw when gaming. Now, of course, these are just benchmark scores, so beyond the impact on gaming, what about typical real life use? Well, if you're surfing the web, watching video, or going on social media, you'll definitely be able to do that with both tablets, but the Tab S9 feels snappier and more responsive. Even just navigating around the UI and opening and closing apps, you can notice the difference and I would expect it to continue to perform better for longer. Now, of course, for more demanding things like photo or video editing, the Tab S9 is the more capable option. But always keep in mind what you plan on doing because you are paying twice as much. Both tablets run the latest Android and One UI so you're getting all the latest features like three tiled apps, pop-up windows, and of course decks, which is awesome. Essentially, it reboots the tablet and gives you an operating system that is very similar to a desktop OS. You're getting a task bar, a desktop with icons, multiple windows, you can snap windows, and you can use a keyboard case to transform your tablet to more of a laptop replacement. One major difference is that you can only connect an external display and then run a super capable dual display setup with the Tab S9. The FE version doesn't have this feature. But you can use either tablet as an additional display for your laptop or desktop with Samsung's Second Screen. And this is a super handy feature when you travel. As far as OS and security updates, Samsung promises four years of OS updates and five years of security updates, which is nice. And again, keep in mind the difference in performance if you plan on keeping your tablet for a while. Looking at battery life, the flagship model has a larger 8,400 mAh battery versus 8,000 on the FE. But Samsung rates the FE model at 18 hours versus 15 on the Tab S9. Now, that I have the entire Tab S9 and FE lineup, I'm reshooting my battery test. So go ahead and subscribe to be notified when it's published. Now, both tablets offer 45 watt fast charging, but neither ships with a charging adapter so that's something that you'll need to get separately. Now, when we look at the configuration options, both start out with 120 gigabytes of internal storage. The Tab S9 comes with 8 gigs of RAM, and the FE model comes with 6 gigs of RAM. If we upgrade to 256 gigabytes of storage on both models, then we're getting 12 gigs of RAM on the Tab S9 and 8 on the FE. So there's no question that the Tab S9 is the more capable tablet. It has a better display, a much more powerful chip with better CPU and GPU performance, better speakers, a better camera system, and a more capable S Pen. But the Tab S9 FE is an outstanding value when you consider the price. If you don't need the best performance or the absolute best display, you're getting a lot of the same features with better battery life for half the price. Now, you should see how the Tab S9 FE compares with the iPad 10. Hopefully this comparison was helpful. Click on my face to subscribe. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.In August we got acquainted with the Galaxy Tab S9 series, with the S9 Ultra model showcasing the best Samsung has to offer in the premium Android tablet segment, and now it's time to meet the Galaxy Tab S9 FE - Fan Edition, the less extravagant alternative proposed to consumers with \"normal\" budgets and more moderate expectations. Being initially for a lower budget, Samsung has prepared the Galaxy Tab S9 FE in only two variants, FE and FE+, leaving the \"behemoth\" Tab S9 Ultra as a go-to solution for those who want everything to the max. We thus have the Tab S9 FE of 10.9 and the Tab S9 FE+ of 12.4 , both with an LCD screen and a mid-performance Exynos chipset. I remind you that starting with the Tab S9 series, Samsung offers OLED screens on all models in the range, including the basic Tab S9, ensuring that the premium tablet offering is differentiated in a way that leaves no room for interpretation. From a distance, you could be forgiven if you can't spot any difference between the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and the standard model. Both come in a brushed aluminum case, with almost identical weight and dimensions. The differences are so small that you can easily use the Galaxy Tab S9 accessories with the FE model. Samsung even retained the IP68 certification, a feature rarely found in tablets in this price range. Even if not entirely, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE still seems like a premium tablet. But since I don't look at things from a distance, let's see where the \"savings\" were made. One clue would be the lack of the S Pen zone on the FE, which is specifically marked on the back of the standard S9. Fortunately, this is only a design omission, as the S Pen included in the FE accessory package can be placed both on the back of the tablet and on the side frame. And as a result of choosing an LCD screen, the fingerprint sensor is now located on the side frame, integrated into the Power button. Far from being a compromise, the capacitive sensor is in an easily accessible location and gives good results, with fingerprint recognition being almost as fast as an optical solution integrated under the screen. Another indication of cost cuts would be the abandonment of the four-speaker configuration, with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE having only two speakers, designed for a stereo listening experience in landscape mode. So, if you're one of those who watch TikTok videos with the tablet in a vertical position, you'll have a less than great audio experience with the speakers in this top-bottom arrangement. On the other hand, the sound itself, \"tuned by AKG\", is of good fidelity and can rise to a reasonable volume without encountering distortion problems. A distinctive feature compared to the non-FE model, the LCD screen is well lit enough even for outdoor use, has vivid colors, and excellent image clarity. Yes, the LCD used doesn't have HDR10+ and can't reproduce the perfect black specific to OLED solutions, but it does more than a decent job. Even when placed side by side, you need to know what to look for to spot the differences between the S9 FE and the more expensive S9 model, released at the end of this summer. So, can the Galaxy Tab S9 FE be a credible alternative to Tab S9? Starting with a good first impression, the temptation would be to say yes. But as always, the truth is somewhere in between. With a price of $450 for the basic FE equipment, compared to the $800 for the Tab S9, it's hard to say no to a tablet like this. The assembly, finishes, and feeling are all right, and the screen, even if it's LCD, is not bad at all. However, you will fully feel the difference elsewhere: specifically, in the performance difference between the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor used by Tab S9, which is also found on the S23 Ultra, and Samsung's proprietary Exynos 1380 on the FE, also found on the Galaxy A54 for example. And the performance levels firmly position the Galaxy Tab S9 FE outside the circle of power users. Delivered with only 6GB of RAM in the basic configuration, the Tab S9 FE should at least be ordered in the 8GB/256GB memory version to enter that specification area for which Samsung optimizes the One UI firmware in the long term. And speaking of One UI, the current Samsung firmware based on Android 14 and One UI 6.0 seems a bit unfinished. Even if I didn't come across serious bugs, the fluidity of the interface and the tendency to \"hang\" at times contrast strongly with the One UI 5.1 experience on the Tab S9. I tend to believe that the weaker chipset is not the problem here, but rather the firmware part, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE needing some optimizations in this chapter. However, One UI features are essentially identical for both tablet series, with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE offering the same set of applications and optimizations for the S Pen, for example. Again, Samsung shows that the FE series is not for power users, restricting the use of DEX mode only to the tablet screen, without the possibility of connecting an external monitor. You can use both the Book Cover keyboard for emulating a mini-laptop or a keyboard and mouse set for PC, connected via Bluetooth. The Dex experience isn't bad, provided you limit yourself to at most two apps displayed simultaneously on the 10.9\" screen. Likewise, if you want to benefit from Air Actions support, you will have to buy the S Pen Pro accessory separately, the one included in the package not offering this option. But as a pleasant surprise, the gaming experience is decent, without stuttering or lag effects. However, it's good to know that in some demanding games, like PUBG, the detail level is automatically reduced to medium and should be kept that way to get a playable framerate. Considering the chipset used, it's no wonder the tablet doesn't heat up much. Moreover, Samsung claims that the 8000 mAh battery can offer more than 20 hours of autonomy in video mode. Moving on to charging, Samsung says there is support for 45W fast charging, but I tested this claim with a 65W AC adapter and a USB-C cable certified for 45W charging, original Samsung accessories, and measured only 36-37W power consumed and almost 90 minutes for a full charge. Well, draw your own conclusions. In the \"other features\" chapter, we have a main 12MP camera and an 8MP front camera. Neither is great, at least not in artificial light, but for video calls and those moments when you can't be bothered to reach for a better-equipped phone, it's probably enough. It's also good to know that you can film with the tablet up to 4K resolution at 30 fps. Now let's take another look at the accessories. Even if Samsung recommends it for on-the-go use, the Outdoor Cover should be an essential accessory for anyone with small children around, or if you're clumsy. Built like a tank, the detachable protective case uses hard plastic for crush and twist protection, while shock and impact protection is provided by the very resistant rubber side frame. The Samsung Outdoor Cover has a retractable stand that allows the tablet to be placed in landscape mode. Also, the space for the S Pen accessory is additionally protected, both against impact and accidental loss of the pen. Before ordering, you should know that the Outdoor Cover is a heavy-duty protective case, which adds quite a bit to the thickness and weight of the tablet. If you don't foresee very careless use of the tablet, then maybe it's worth taking a look at other Samsung cases. And we have another interesting optional accessory: the S Pen Creator Edition is a significant upgrade from the S Pen version included in the Tab S9 FE package, with support for Air Actions. If the first can be thought of as a pen or pencil with a thin tip, the S Pen Creator Edition is a little heavier and thicker, enough to feel like you're using a real pencil and not something \"toy-like.\" Helpful is also the tip that very well imitates the shape of a drawing pencil lead. However, to avoid the feeling of slipping on the glossy glass, I also recommend the Note Paper Screen accessory. As the name suggests, this is like a kind of film made of transparent plastic and is placed over the display. The matte-type foil has a specially chosen texture to mimic the feeling of sliding on real paper, and I think it's a must-have, if you know you will work a lot with the pen. The good part is that whichever S Pen version you choose to use, you won't have problems with lag or insufficient sensitivity, both working flawlessly, as you would expect from a latest generation Samsung device. And speaking of accessories, let's discuss a bit about the new Galaxy Buds FE. Worth watching in future promotional campaigns, the Buds FE come at $100 and are a good alternative to the Galaxy Buds2 Pro, which were around $220 at launch. Both are offered in almost identical cases, with a matte finish and the Samsung logo embossed on the Buds2 Pro case, respectively, glossy plastic and printed logo on the Buds FE case. Buds2 Pro have a slightly rounder shape, touch operation, and feel a bit heavier in hand. In contrast, Buds FE have more easily noticeable joint areas and don't feel quite as premium. Fortunately, the performance differences between the two aren't that big. Tested side by side, both have decent bass and a decently high volume. The Hi-Fi sensation is clearly superior on the Buds2 Pro, which come with dedicated speakers for bass and mid-highs, hence probably the noticeable weight difference. While I wouldn't go as far as to say it disappoints, listening on the Buds FE has some downsides regarding the playback of mid-high frequencies, some instruments and nuances being covered by the strong bass. The noise-canceling functionality is also clearly weaker on the FE, with Buds2 Pro maintaining a decisive advantage here. Overall, the Buds FE are certainly not to be avoided, but neither to be bought blindly at full price. And the last but not least interesting accessory of today is this SmartTag2. Along with the Tab S9 FE, Samsung also unveiled the latest version of the SmartTag accessory. Even though it retains the basic functionality unchanged, SmartTag2 comes with a much-improved exterior design and extra features like ultra-wideband connectivity, which was only found in the SmartTag Plus series so far. If the first SmartTag version was rather rudimentary in design, shaped like a slightly thicker plastic coin, SmartTag2 is a much more refined gadget, which you'll probably hate to hide somewhere in your luggage. However, Samsung has also made changes that you might not like, with SmartTag2 no longer being as invisible as the first generation. If the former was basically a coin that you could easily attach anywhere you needed, the new version is more like a stylish keychain, with Samsung seeming to want to get rid of the undesired stalker accessory image, used by jealous lovers. Instead, you can attach the SmartTag2 to a belt or other thicker objects than a cord. And if you really want full flexibility, know that there is also a Rugged Case equipped with a self-locking ring, working like a hook for attaching to various objects, such as luggage or a pet's collar. Samsung has also kept the programmable function button. For example, you can set an emergency message from the SmartThings app, a simple button press sending an SMS with your location data to a trusted person. It should be mentioned that this functionality is not guaranteed in every situation, for example, if you are in an isolated location, and there is no other nearby device to relay the triggered alert. Alright, now that we're done with the accessories, let's answer that thousand points question: is the Galaxy Tab S9 FE a credible Tab S9 alternative? Yes and no. Yes, if you fall into the category of users targeted by Samsung. Are you a student or simply in need of a tablet to work on, possibly on the go? If you want to use the tablet at home for movies, email, or just wasting time on social media, the Tab S9 FE performs admirably in all these roles. It's a slim and lightweight tablet with premium finishes and enough processing power to handle many scenarios. Moreover, it's a tablet priced fairly for what it offers. On the other hand, I don't recommend the Tab S9 FE if you already own a top-tier phone and want your future tablet to be an extension of it. You will feel the performance difference, and we all know what it's like to switch between devices that aren't on the same level. Also, if you want to do video editing on a tablet, play games after manually maxing out all settings, or simply want an experience completely free from compromises, then the Tab S9, with its OLED screen and Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and significantly pricier, remains the obvious choice. And now, let me know in the comments section: what do you think of the Galaxy Tab S9 FE? And while you're here, please subscribe to Techniqulities! Take care and good luck to you all!okay so I've made a short on this and I've made videos about these Monster tablets in the past and every single time people get really into them and I'm really into them but the question that always keeps coming up every time is are these actually iPad Killers like is an iPad killer a real thing so let's talk about it this is the newest highest end Android Tablet from Samsung the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra and it's even more ridiculous than the previous year's already crazy Ultra and I love it so I've already made a video on the tab S7 plus and then last year the tab S8 Ultra if you haven't already seen that I'll link it below that was last year's version and so now just like the rest of Samsung's recent announcements this new one mostly looks the same as last year's version but all the changes they've made are in the same direction just making it even more capable so you've got this gigantic 14.6 inch tablet that I mean it feels like I'm holding a small TV in my hands it somehow also razor thin with a huge battery inside and it actually doesn't snap in half despite looking like it probably should be susceptible to that but hey watch The X video for yourself if you don't believe me it survives better than a lot of other devices have this year though a new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy inside plus a new Vapor chamber cooling system under the hood so there's going to be an even higher ceiling for performance for everything it's already good at we've seen this thing do multitasking well for years and be quick to scroll around and open and close apps with normal usage and now it'll do better at gaming and video editing and potentially also last a bit longer on that same 11 200 milliamp hour battery that's bigger than any battery that's ever been in an iPad this year the quad speaker setup is also now made up of 20 larger speakers which is a pretty big jump and I'm not ready to call these the best sounding speakers in any tablet quite yet that's still that goes to the iPad Pro still but these sure do get really loud with very little Distortion and you can flip on Dolby Atmos audio if you want some pretty impressive surround sound effects for music or videos or games and then this entire tablet is now ip68 water and dust resistant for the first time which means it's safe to not just splash it with water but literally completely submerge the whole thing underwater and it'll be totally fine which is crazy I don't know any situation where you would end up with a tablet underwater maybe you're recklessly watching Netflix next to a pool or something and then you drop it in I don't know that but if you did it will still be fine but then on top of that this S Pen also comes in the Box again and this thing also now has an ip68 rating of its own and it also now supports bi-directional charging but not the bi-directional charging you're probably thinking of when you can accept charge from the tablet but also charge other things no I just mean whatever Direction the pen faces when you magnetize it to the back of the tablet it will work and charge perfectly fine which is better than last year what I'm surprised doesn't come in the box is any charging brick I mean for a tablet that does everything this thing is actually capable of 45 watt charging which is really solid but the only way to get that is to buy a charger something like this anchor Prime desktop charger which I would totally get over any Samsung first party charger because it's gallium nitride it's smaller and then it also has multi-port charging up to 240 Watts Max output so you could literally charge a laptop full speed and the tablet full speed at the same time but then of course they also make a really convenient battery Bank option so this this is the anchor Prime 250 watt battery bank with two USBC ports and one USB a port it has a built-in inductive wireless charging pad so that can charge the battery Bank up to 100 watts and then there's an app connected to it that lets you configure the display and optimize charging or even play a sound to find it it's way more advanced than any charger that's ever come in any Samsung bucks so shout out to anchor for sponsoring this video and I'll put a link in the description for you to check this one out right below that like button but the point is I mean you've seen all the specs now they're all huge numbers it's a 14 and a half inch screen in my hands it's 120 hertz it's an 11 200 milliamp hour battery it's quad speakers it's the minimum 12 gigs of RAM it's a terabyte of internal storage with up to another terabyte of micro SD card storage all these numbers are great but it's actually using this tablet and actually holding it it's it's hard to describe it to you but it's even more hilariously fun so I'm personally partial to like media idea consumption on devices like this like I would just want to watch YouTube videos on a gigantic screen take them with me download them offline watch them on flights with my free time like it's already amazing for that and honestly I think that's what most people do on tablets a lot of the time but of course for all the additional stuff that tablet power users are going to be doing there is just so much more that this thing is capable of basically it's at the Forefront of tablets there's all of Samsung's multi-window multitasking features and pop-up windows on that 16x10 aspect ratio display all of the stylus features which if you want to use a stylus on a tablet it feels like Samsung and Apple are really the only ones taking it seriously but you know I'm using it to sign documents every once in a while but there are some people whose entire workflows go through this thing and then you can't forget about decks there's a whole clever keyboard folio case that I didn't even have here for this one but I had it for the S8 Ultra and that adds a whole nother Dimension and Dex mode has been super used useful while giving you that desktop experience with independent windows and you can plug it into an even larger display if you want to it's more powerful than anything Apple has even tried to do on the iPad and all of that isn't even mentioning that this is probably the biggest camera viewfinder anyone has ever used Plus on the front that little Notch up there I've mentioned this before but there's two selfie cameras a front-facing normal camera and an ultra wide that can do auto framing in videos or in video calls similar to what Apple calls Center Stage except these cameras are actually in the right place on the long side of the tablet so all that being said can this be an iPad killer that's the question we keep asking and it's a good it's a real question like this is clearly competing against the iPad Pro the biggest baddest iPad Pro but it's going to have a lot of things a lot of features a lot of numbers to one-up the iPad Pro right it's got a bigger screen it's got bigger speakers it's got external expandable storage it's got the fingerprint reader that the iPad Pro doesn't have and all of that costs a hundred dollars more than the equivalent iPad Pro this reminds me of the conversation we've had about Sony phones like in the world of Android phones Sony is out here making incredibly well-equipped super high-end phones with a ton of Enthusiast features and expandable memory and manual controls that the competition like just straight up doesn't offer and that's only really at the expense of a little bit of automatic mode usability and price like they just they're expensive they cost more and while it's really easy to point out all the obvious benefits and advantages to all these extra features and these cool things that it does it turns out that the number of people who will actually take advantage of these features is Tiny and I mean they're everywhere on YouTube but when it comes to actually voting with their wallets most people end up just going with the sort of more standard one and I feel like there is a similar phenomenon Happening Here for whatever reason videos about these tablets do numbers they're they're going crazy like people love to see these on video and I like talking about them but then when it comes to actually buying them people uh the the ecosystem effect is way stronger than any uh YouTube comments would suggest people love flocking to the iPad for iMessage and FaceTime and all these other things but to keep it even more simple I like I have this analogy that I really like even better people like bigger screens as long as it doesn't sacrifice too much in the other areas of the device so take the MacBook Air for example that 13-inch MacBook Air was one of the best selling laptops for years it was Apple's number one best-selling laptop for a long time and people wanted a bigger screen but the only way that they could get a bigger screen and still buy an Apple product was to move all the way up to the 16-inch MacBook Pro which was just dramatically more expensive I mean it was Overkill most people did not need that much computer and so people would actually start to drift away and go buy a different slightly bigger screened laptop from some other company so much so that Apple finally this year decided to introduce a larger 15-inch MacBook Air and it turned out that's exactly what people wanted they just want the bigger screen on the other end of this apple tried introducing a mini iPhone for two whole years which you would think is a brilliant idea if you only read YouTube comments but again it turns out most people want the bigger screen and so that ended up not selling enough it got discontinued and today we have a plus phone instead so this is a bigger screen tablet than the iPad Pro which is why it's so amazing and impressive to hold and look at but it's also a very different tablet from the iPad Pro it's 100 bucks more but it's an Android tablet it has a whole different feature set and for a lot of people that's too much sacrifice and a lot of people will continue to just get iPads but for those who are not looped into the ecosystem and who don't depend on these features this is a hell of a tablet thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace- When Samsung released the Tab S9 FE and FE+, they made things really interesting. But at the same time, choosing which tablet to get might be more confusing, so let's break it down. To make things a little bit easier, let's put these tablets up into two categories: the fan edition models and the flagship models. And this makes sense because essentially the features are the same for every tablet in each category with a few exceptions. And here's a quick look at the starting prices. So starting out with the displays, both categories have an aspect ratio of 16:10, which makes them great for watching content. But in terms of specs, that's pretty much where the similarities end. The FE models have IPS/LCD displays, which offer a slower 90 hertz adaptive refresh rate with a good resolution and pixel density. All three flagship models have Dynamic AMOLED 2X displays, which offer a faster 120 hertz adaptive refresh rate, a higher resolution when comparing the same display sizes so you can see more content without having to scroll, and we're also getting a higher pixel density when comparing the same display sizes, which gives us a sharper image. And in terms of image quality, the FE displays are actually quite good, and I'm super happy with the image quality for watching video and for playing games. I also love that we're getting 90 hertz versus the 60 hertz we got on the Tab S7 FE, which was the last fan edition model. But there's no question that the dynamic AMOLED display on the flagship models is the better display. Colors seem to just pop right off the screen. We're getting outstanding blacks, better contrast, and the UI animations look smoother. Overall, the advantage in terms of image quality clearly goes to the flagship models. But keep in mind the cost because the flagship displays are not twice as good as the fan edition ones. Now all five tablets have a similar design with a full aluminum frame and back, but when comparing the tablets of the same size, the flagship models are thinner. Now, I love that Samsung was able to bring IP68 rating down to the FE version. This gives all the tablets protection from water and dust. Now, this is really nice if you take your tablet with you when you travel or if you take it to school with you every day. But it's also a super nice feature when you're using it around the house and you have a dog with a somewhat aggressive tail. Now, all five tablets offer face recognition for biometric authentication and a more secure fingerprint sensor. Now with the flagship models, we're getting an under display sensor, and with the FE models, it's integrated into the power button. Now, both sensors have worked really great for me, and they're super responsive and accurate. But I prefer the under display version because it's more natural to how I hold the tablet. All five tablets also have a micro SD card slot, so you can upgrade the internal storage by up to one terabyte. And you can use that storage for photos, for videos, for files, and for most apps. Now, continuing to look around the edges, we're getting four AKG-tuned speakers on the flagship models versus two on the FE. And the flagship models absolutely have a more full sound. The audio seems warmer, it has more presence to it, which actually makes them a better choice if you want to use the speakers on your tablet. Now, another factor to consider is the ability to expand the functionality of each tablet by adding a keyboard case and a stylus. Now since the form factor of the flagship and the FE models is so similar, the Tab S9 and FE are compatible with the same two versions of the book cover keyboards from Samsung. And the same is true for the FE+ and the Tab S9+. And then, of course, you can always use an external Bluetooth keyboard with all of these tablets. All five tablets also come with a free S pen, which can be stored on the side or on the back of the tablet. But only the flagship models come with a Bluetooth enabled S pen, which offers some wireless functionality for things like camera control and media playback. Now in terms of the actual writing experience, it's virtually identical and no charges required in order to write and draw. It's only needed for the Bluetooth functionality with the flagship models. Now, one of the areas where Samsung had to create some differentiation is with processing power, and there are several critical implications here. So the flagship models come with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and the FE models come with the Exynos 1380, so let's quickly look at the single and multi-core performance. And here we can see that the Snapdragon chip definitely pulls ahead. We also see it's scored considerably higher in GPU performance. Now, of course, these are just benchmark scores. So what kind of impact is this gonna have during typical real life use? Well, if you're just surfing the web, watching video, or going on social media, you're definitely gonna be able to do that with any of these tablets. But the flagship models definitely feel snappier and more responsive. And even if you're just navigating around the UI and opening and closing apps, you're going to notice the difference. And I would expect the flagship models to continue and perform better for longer because of the additional headroom in terms of performance. Now, of course, for more demanding things, like photo and video editing, the flagship models are a more capable option, but always keep in mind what you actually plan on doing because you are paying quite a bit more. Now, another area where I definitely noticed a meaningful difference is with gaming. I play a lot on my tablets, and I was really curious to see how these processors would match up. So I was able to play my usual games like PUBG, Genshin Impact, Asphalt, and then, of course, some less demanding games. But there was a very obvious difference in both processing power and GPU performance, which did have an impact on my overall experience with more resource intensive games. Now using PUBG as an example, gameplay was smoother and more responsive on the flagship models, and I could play with graphics set to smooth and frame rate set to 90 FPS. I could also set graphics anywhere from balanced to HDR and frame rate set to extreme or Ultra HD for graphics and Ultra for frame rate. With the FE models, I was limited to high frame rate, weather graphics were set to smooth, balanced, or HD, and that was as good as it got. So I definitely didn't get to use the 90 FPS. Now playing Genshin Impact, I had a very similar experience where it's playable on all five tablets, but it performed better on the flagship models, again, because of the more capable processor and the additional RAM, which I'll discuss in a minute. So if gaming is a priority for you now, then looking ahead, we know that game developers are always going to push the CPU and GPU, and games are going to evolve and start to demand more and more resources. When I look to keep a device for at least four to five years or even longer, I'm always going to opt for the tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance than what I need right now. And that way it will continue to perform better in the future. Now if you want to stream and play Xbox games with the Xbox Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox controller with all five tablets and then have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection. In terms of storage, the Tab S9 FE, the Tab S9, and the Tab S9 FE+ start out with 128 gigabytes. Then, the Tab S9+ and the Tab S9 Ultra start out with 256. So that's something that you want to keep in mind if you play a lot of games and you need more storage. Now looking at the camera systems, we're getting different setups and features depending on which model and category you go with. But in terms of the front facing camera, all three flagships have the same setup, and then the two FE models have the same setup. And here's a quick sample. This is a camera and microphone test of the Tab S9 and the Tab S9 FE. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect for video calls. Here's a camera and microphone test of the Tab S9+ and the Tab S9 FE+. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect. Now, the Tab S9+ looks a little overexposed to me. All I did was press record, I didn't change any of the settings. The color is also definitely different on the FE+. It seems like a much warmer image and probably a better exposure, which is really interesting. Now, all five tablets run the latest Android and One UI, so you're getting all of the latest features, like three tiled apps, pop-up windows, and then, of course, decks, which is awesome. So essentially, it reboots the tablet and gives you an operating system that's very similar to a desktop OS. You're getting a task bar, a desktop with icons, multiple windows, you can snap windows, and you can use a keyboard case to transform your tablet into more of a laptop replacement. Now if you use decks, you can connect a keyboard and mouse to all five tablets. But one massive difference is that you can only connect an external display and run a dual display setup with the flagship models. The FE models don't have this ability. You can, however, use each of the five tablets as an additional display for your laptop or desktop with Samsung's Second Screen. And this is a super handy feature for me both in the office and when I travel. Now as far as OS and security updates, Samsung promised four years of OS updates and five years of security updates, which is nice. And again, keep in mind the difference in performance if you plan on keeping your tablet for a while. Now, in terms of battery life, we're getting larger battery sizes as we go up in tablet size. And you can check out this video if you wanna see a detailed battery drain test. Now, all five tablets offer 45 watts, super fast charging, but none of them ship with a charging adapter. So that's something you'll need to get separately. Now when we look at the configuration options, it's important that we look both at the RAM and storage options in the base and upgraded models. And remember that while only the Tab S9 Ultra is offered with one terabyte, you can expand the internal storage on all five tablets with a micro SD card. And there's no question that the flagship models are more capable. They have better display, a much more powerful chip with better CPU and GPU performance, better speakers, a better camera system, and a more capable S pen. But if you're on a budget and you don't need the best, the FE models are an outstanding value, and you're still getting a very good display, IP68 rating, a free S pen, and a lot of the same features for significantly less money. Now, you should check out the battery drain test. You know what I always say. Buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.- If you look closely, you'll notice that even though the Tab S9+ and the Tab S9 FE+ look very similar, there are some incredibly meaningful differences for both average and power users. Neither of these tablets have the most powerful chip Samsung has put in a mobile device. That honor is currently reserved for the S24 Ultra and the rest of the S24 lineup, with the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 chip. And at the same time, processing power is one meaningful differentiator between these two tablets, along with the display, the speakers, the camera, multitasking, and the stylus. Keep in mind that we have to take price into account because we're looking at $999 for the base Tab S9+ versus 549 for the FE+. And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. Now I mentioned multitasking, which might be a little confusing because both tablets run the latest Android and One UI, and that means that you are technically getting all of the latest features, like three-tiled apps, pop-up windows, and then of course, DeX, which is awesome. Essentially, DeX reboots the tablet and gives it an operating system that's very similar to a desktop OS. You're getting a task bar, a desktop with icons, multiple windows, you can snap windows, and you can use a keyboard case to transform your tablet into more of a laptop replacement. But there is one important DeX feature that's only available on the Tab S9+, and that's the ability to connect an external display and run a super capable dual display setup. The FE+ version does not have this feature. You can, however, use either tablet as an additional display for your Windows laptop or desktop with Samsung's Second Screen, and I use this feature both in the office and when I travel. Now looking at the displays, both are 12.4 inches, and have the same aspect ratio of 16 by 10, which makes them great for watching content. But in terms of the actual specs, that's pretty much where the similarities end. The Tab S9+ has a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, which offers 120 hertz adaptive refresh rate, a resolution of 1752 by 2800, and a pixel density of 266 pixels per inch. The Tab S9 FE+ has an IPS LCD display, which offers a slower 90 hertz adaptive refresh rate, a lower resolution of 1600 by 2560, and a lower pixel density of 243 pixels per inch. In terms of image quality, the FE+ display is very good. And for the price, we're getting terrific image quality for watching video and for playing games. And while we're not getting 120 hertz and the animations and scrolling are not as smooth as they are in the Tab S9+, we are getting 90 hertz, which is a step up from the previous FE model. Now having said that, there's no question that the Dynamic AMOLED 2X display on the flagship model is the superior display. Colors seem to pop off the screen, we're getting outstanding blacks, better contrast, and again, the UI animations and scrolling looks smoother. Overall, I have to give the edge to the Tab S9+, but I don't think that I would pay twice as much just for the display. As far as the overall design, the two tablets are very similar with a full aluminum frame in back. They have the same footprint, but the Tab S9+ is a bit thinner and lighter. I appreciate that Samsung was able to bring the IP68 rating down to the FE+ version, giving both tablets protection from water and dust. This is really valuable if you take your tablet with you when you travel or if you take it to work, but it's also a great feature when you're just around the house and you have a dog that likes to clear everything off the table with her tail. Both tablets offer face recognition for biometric authentication and a more secure fingerprint sensor. With the Tab S9+, we're getting an under-display sensor, and with the FE+, it's integrated into the power button. Now, both sensors have worked great for me and they're super responsive and accurate, but I prefer the under-display version on the Tab S9+ because it's more organic to how I hold the tablet. Now, both tablets also have a MicroSD card slot, so you can upgrade the internal storage by up to one terabyte, and you can use that storage for photos, for videos, files, and for most apps. Now, continuing to look around the edges, we're getting four AKG tuned speaker on the Tab S9+ versus two on the FE+. And the flagship model definitely has a more full sound. The audio seems warmer and has more presence to it, which makes it a better choice for watching content. Now, both tablets have a USB-C port for charging and connecting accessories, but we're looking at 3.2 on the Tab S9+ versus only 2.0 on the FE+. Now, depending on what type of games you play, you may or may not notice a difference. If you're just playing less demanding games, you can easily do that on both tablets, but as you start playing more resource-intensive games, like \"Genshin Impact,\" \"COD Mobile,\" and \"PUBG,\" there's a noticeable difference in both processing power and GPU performance, which does have an impact on my gaming experience. I'll quickly cover benchmarks and the Performance section, but there's no question that Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 gen 2 chip in the Tab S9+ is more capable than the Exynos 1380 in the FE+ version. Starting with \"Genshin Impact,\" I was able to play it on both devices, but the game performed better on the Tab S9+, with smoother graphics and less lag because of the more capable processor and the additional RAM. When playing \"PUBG,\" gameplay was smoother and more responsive on the Tab S9+. And I could play with Graphics set to Smooth and Frame Rate set to 90 FPS. I could also set graphics anywhere from Balanced to HDR and Frame Rate set to Extreme, or Ultra HD for Graphics and Ultra for Frame Rate. With the FE+ model, I was limited to High Frame Rate, whether graphics were set to Smooth, Balanced, or HD. And then, of course, since that was as good as it got, I could get nowhere near 90 FPS. If playing more demanding games is a priority for you, then we know that game developers are always going to push the CPU and GPU and games are going to continue to evolve and demand more and more resources. When I look to keep a device for at least four to five years or even more, I'm always going to opt for the tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance than what I need now so that it continues to perform well in the future. Now, if you want to stream and play Xbox Games with the Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox controller with both tablets and have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection.

Now back to the tablets, another important factor for some users is the ability to expand the functionality of each tablet by adding a keyboard case and a stylus. Now, both tablets are compatible with the same two versions of the Book Cover Keyboard from Samsung. And of course, you can always use an external keyboard and mouse. Now, both tablets also come with a free S Pen, which can be stored on the side or on the back of the tablet, but only the Tab S9+ has a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen, which offers some wireless functionality for things like camera and media playback. Now in terms of the actual writing or drawing experience, for most users, it's virtually identical, and neither requires a charge in order to write or draw. Looking at the camera systems, the Tab S9+ has a 13 megapixel wide and an eight megapixel ultrawide versus two eight megapixel cameras on the Tab S9 FE+. Both tablets have a 12 megapixel selfie camera, and here's a short sample. Here's a camera and microphone test of the Tab S9+. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get. And the Tab S9+ looks a little overexposed me. All I did was press Record. I didn't change any of the settings. We quickly talked about performance in the Gaming section. So let's look at the single and multi-core performance of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and the Exynos 1380, where we see the Snapdragon chip pull way ahead. We also see a score considerably higher in GPU performance, which helps explain some of the meaningful differences we saw when gaming. But I know that not everyone games, and these are just benchmarks. So what about typical average real life use? Well, of course you can surf the web, watch videos, or go on social media with both tablets, but essentially, in every aspect, the Tab S9+ feels snappier and more responsive. Even just navigating around the UI, opening and closing apps, you can notice a difference. And I would expect it to continue to perform better for longer. Now, power users who perform more demanding tasks, like photo and video editing, should definitely opt for the more capable Tab S9+. But always keep in mind what you plan on doing so that you don't overpay for performance that you don't need. Now, as far as OS and security updates, Samsung promises four years of OS updates and five years of security updates, which is nice. And again, keep in mind the difference in performance if you plan on keeping your tablet for a while. In terms of battery life, both tablets have a 10,090 milliampere-hour battery, but Samsung rates the FE+ model at 20 hours versus 16 hours on the Tab S9+. Now that I have the entire Tab S9 and FE lineup, I'm finishing the edit of my battery test. So go ahead and subscribe to be notified when it's published. Now, both Tablets offer 45 watts Super Fast Charging, which gets you to 100% in about 90 minutes, but neither tablet ships with a charging adapter, so that's something that you'll need to get separately. Now, when we look at the configuration options, the Tab S9+ is available with 256 or 512 gigabytes of internal storage, and both models come with 12 gigabytes of RAM. The FE+ model comes with 120 gigabytes of storage and eight gigs of RAM, or 256 and 12. Now, of course, more RAM is always better, but your typical FE+ user isn't a power user, so I would only upgrade the RAM if you also need the additional internal storage. Now, overall, it's clear that the Tab S9+ is the more powerful and capable tablet, has a better display, a much more powerful chip with better CPU and GPU performance, more internal storage, better speakers, a better camera system, external display support, and a better S Pen. But at about half the price, the Tab S9 FE+ is a very good value. If you don't need the best performance or the absolute best quality display, you're still getting the same size display, IP68 protection, and a lot of the same features, with better battery life.

      "this is xiaomi's new latest tablet from them it is called the xiaomi pad 6 Pro the top spec version now it's at the time of this video only an exclusive Chinese release I hope it's going to be Global but we might only see the xiaomi pad 6 unfortunately it's very thin it's light it's got a lot of power great battery life so many things going for it so let's find out why I think this model definitely needs a global release so this unit I got from giztop and I'm really surprised by their shipping came with DHL and it only took three days amazingly quick so we get this paperwork here that is in Chinese of course this being the domestic model here it's not Global just yet I hope it is going to be Global and especially this pro model a 67 watt charger so it fully charges the tablet in just one hour and that is their claim but I get just over that it's not bad at all for a 8 600 milliamp hour battery and of course the cable so that's what is included there is no SIM tray tool because there's no sim support so I'm really liking the build quality of this xiaomi pad 6 Pro this is a matte finish on the back of it the middle the alloy feels really good the edges aren't too sharp they're not super rounded off either and then we've got of course our 15 megapixel camera right here there's a mic on the rear dual tone LED flash and two megapixel depth camera so great that it's not a two megapixel macro that really has no point but the depth camera is to help out with the portrait shots so three Pogo Port pin connectors right here for the attachable optional keyboard there's also an optional stylus now this review unit did not come from xiaomi that I've got right here and unfortunately I don't have the keyboard or the stylus it just wasn't ready in time giztop did not have it now I've got some super exciting news that I am so happy about and I'm going to use it and I have been and that is the type C Port here yes finally you guessed it it does support video out so we don't have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and no micro SD but we've gained that video out and it is USB 3.2 now it's only the five gigabits per second but I'll take that over USB 2 speeds any day microphone here we've got two of our loudspeakers and these are Dolby Atmos they do support they'll be at most the screen also does support Dolby Vision so you can see on the other side there they are and it's marking there the Dolby Vision Dolby Atmos now this is not a SIM tray sadly this model unlike the previous it does not have SIM support so no network connectivity with it this is a capacitive always on fingerprint reader slash power button there is face unlocking with a 20 megapixel camera right here and it does seem to work pretty well but remember it's not that secure but the fingerprint reader is and this is working really well so I've enabled through the settings that this to touch it to enable it which can sometimes trigger some accidental ones but I simply just tap it and you'll see there it goes and unlocks just like that now that isn't the fastest I have seen from a fingerprint reader but it's not bad I'll do that one more time so touching it now all right that was a lot quicker that was under a second and the bezels they're not bad at all okay with it now the tablet is light it is just 490 grams and the thickness is the best part I think it is 6.5 millimeters now you see up here we have a blank here now that's not anything it's not a button it's not a SIM tray that's probably where the SIM tray would be if they did have the network support with it so we've got microphones here and a metal volume and up and down button now these buttons do not rattle they have a very good feel to it so overall the build quality is excellent from the xiaomi pad 6 Pro our display here is an IPS now 144 Hertz is the refresh rate now I do have this widget enabled through the developer options because I want to look at the frame rate and the refresh rate now I've been monitoring this and I can happily report here yes it is 144 Hertz and it is running at normally 144 frames per second you see the occasional dip down to like 135 or something like that but it's normal that is going to happen on any tech there so that is just fine there now looking at the screen brightness is 450 Nets is what I'm measuring just over that they claim it's 550 so I'm not able to quite get that it could be down to my panel or it could be that they've just upped that result a little bit that could be also my measuring equipment but it's good it's a bright screen looks great now when you look at it at certain angles because it's an IPS you're going to see this slightly darker edges to it so there is that now if it was OLED or an AMOLED screen which personally I would have preferred this to have been it wouldn't have this issue the colors would be a little bit more uniformed so what you're looking at is the out of the box here configuration the colors so what they do have set is the the vibrant mode so I'll just go sorry into our display settings here and I'll just show you that so you can see the UI performance is really good everything's running fantastic really really fast so it's 128 gigabytes ufs 3.1 storage and 8 gigabytes of RAM time that I do have with us but non-expandable now you see here uh the different modes we've got so color scheme you can adjust that oh it's original color Pro that I do have it on sorry you've got Vivid then saturated so if you want something that mimics a little bit like an OLED screen then just whack it into uh saturated there but no it's a very good screen I'm happy with it now in direct sunlight you'll you'll struggle a little bit with it with that 400 and about 58 or so nits that I'm measuring it's all right it's fine and indoors will you'll probably be using the tablet no it's looking really good now it does run Android 13 and we have MIUI pad they call it 14 so this is specific to the tablets and as I just said before the performance is excellent now I believe and I've experienced this with all my reviews of xiaomi products that the Chinese ROMs seem to just have the best performance overall they really seem to just be a bit faster they don't show that little spinning icon when you unlock things it all seems to this pop up really quick there so you can see there that it's a new iPad 14.0 0.3 there was one update that I'll show you later on for it and storage here I don't have an amazing amount so I'd probably be better off at least with my own needs to get the 256 gigabyte model but no it's been really quick gestures touch is working quite well and they do have a few features here that they've customized for tablets so they've got their kids space keywords for tablet you can go through but I just run gboard here and floating windows you can do split screen all of that good stuff we do of course have and I'll just go into Chrome here for example and show you like you can set this up as split screen so you can just hold it here and go there you go I want to have it on one side here then bring up my gallery that's possible and again when you're using both of them at least with chrome here because it's reasonably lightweight it's very fluid and still we are managing to pump out yeah 144 frames per second although it's just telling me 60 now depends on the content so this here the album has gone to 60 oh no there we go since I touched it it's gone back up to 144. so it is a variable reflex refresh rate which I will also show you there too so I forgot to mention that just before about our display do apologize for that very important so refresh rate override I always just force it to 144 I want that performance but this is really good I'm so happy that I'm sitting here and saying this look they have 90 Hertz The Sweet Spot so if you want that battery life but you don't want to take a huge hit on it of course we're only 144 but you still want things to be smooth it's definitely 90 Hertz you want to run with this tablet so the UI their performance I'm not really seeing any lag everything seems to be great and I'm loving this I can't believe I'm actually saying this this MIUI version this is good this is very good what I'm seeing out of this Chinese ROM so it's not Global and it doesn't come with Google Play installed but you can install it yourself now the tablet does not have any flicker it doesn't suffer from that issue you won't see any banding or any flick or any problems you get that with the OLED screens AMOLED screens but this is IPS so we're not suffering from the pulse width modulation issue that some of you do have the latest patch here so we have a security patch level of April now so we are up to date and here this is what the ROM is like after you remove all the Chinese bloatware so yes there is quite a bit there's all these different Chinese apps on there but when you clean it up just remove here Netflix wasn't there Amazon Prime video and gentian those are my Omen stalls there but once you get rid of that you are basically bloatware free I think it's even better here than the global ROMs from xiaomi that tend to be quite bloated this doesn't seem to be as bad and a lot of things you can just completely get rid of so it does have a wide Vine level one cert so this means well Netflix is going to be in full HD Disney plus Amazon Prime video and Netflix I've been watching a lot of on this tablet because I love the size of it being 11 inches very comfortable and only 490 grams it's great I think for just media consumption like that so full HD but we don't have HDR support now this is an HDR 10 supporting tablet it also does have Dolby Vision but for some reason Netflix is not recognizing that so maybe that'll be fixed when the global version does come out I really do hope so battery life phenomenal super good here I think it's because of I don't know various factors probably the IPS screen but more but probably because of just the optimization of this ROM really good and an 8 600 milliamp hour battery is a decent size for an 11 inch tablet so what I'm looking at is around about 9 to 10 hours is what you can squeeze out of this thing and even just using it over a few days and use it a few hours every day the battery drain the standby battery drain has been excellent really good and it drops down a little bit and when you're watching video I've been watching a lot of Netflix has mentioned it really hardly loses anything so the battery life is great I only probably need to charge this maybe once a year five days or so and that's using it every day a few hours now stress testing it this is the 20 minute very demanding graphically that is Benchmark the loops and Loops from 3dmark Wildlife extreme test and look at this it only throttled down not even four percent brilliant really good you see this when you game and I have my gaming test coming up soon that The Thermals are great doesn't seem to really throttle at all and they've done a very good job there with the cooling of the Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 with this 11 inch tablet now internal storage very quick this says ufs 3.1 so yeah it's not ufs 4.0 the latest and greatest uh but you need the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for that of course but these speeds no one's going to be complaining about them I mean look at the random reads and writes they are very good and there is no layer coming from this tablet when you're installing or loading your applications or even just viewing your gallery with a lot of photos and apps and different documents there's no lag with that at all so a very respectable great score here we are looking at Flagship performance still even though yes it's the last gen chip so just over a million points here for our antutu score that's great and it only went up 3.9 degrees Celsius losing three percent battery three very good result here a great use of this tablet is this too as well so ebooks PDF files I will just jump into this which is quite a heavy uh file here that is running now through this PDF file through Google Books and you can see here I'll just dismiss that it wants me to go over into the night mode the performance is excellent now this is not still quite iPad level when it comes to heavy PDF files I don't think they'll ever be able to match that but it still does really good it plays a little bit of catch up so holding it and portrait comfortable it's only the 400 of course and 90 grams and really I have found it to be a great device here for ebooks and PDFs so have a look now quickly at a eBook and this is great it does look good the text is sharp I don't find I really strain my eyes and do remember that you can invert the text so you can have the background black the text white if you find that a little bit more comfortable you can put a blue light filter on and you can also make this all grayscale and just change a few things there to make it even more comfortable so as an ebook reader it is fantastic for that a little bit Overkill too with that kind of performance every Gamers out there you've got fantastic performers here with the xiaomi pad 6 Pro it's very good so I have it on the highest visual settings here again chain impact and you can see the frame rate well it's 60 frames per second normally solid I do sometimes see it occasionally dipped to 51 51 or 50 is the lowest that I have seen with this game which is great and yes I do realize I'm not in a super built up area so it could lag a little bit more but this is probably one of the best kind of performances you're going to see out of a tablet with this price point here so great for gamers great gaming performance and because of the Quad speakers very immersive great audio and just in general I love gaming on the xiaomi pad 6 Pro and what about our audio so we have the four speakers on this side and if you are holding it like so and you're watching for example some YouTube videos you can accidentally block at least two of those speakers but I don't find it to be too much of an issue now of course if you've got a tablet stand you'll use that or if you have the keyboard you can use that instead and these speakers here so they are Adobe audio speakers the four of them quite loud reasonable amount of bass well just a little bit meds are fine they're actually pretty good speakers for an 11 inch tablet so I'll give you a sample of them but just before I do this is YouTube playback here at 1080p I've set it to the higher picture quality in fact no that's 4K that it is currently playing right now and look at it it's smooth it's fine it does not seem to be dropping any frames per second because it's running at 29 to 30 frames per second here but anyway here's a sample of the four speakers oh so those speakers they sound really good good volume to them xiaomi overall they have done an excellent job with the quad speakers we get with the pad 6 Pro and over to the video now you can expect out of the xiaomi pad 6 Pro so this is the front facing camera 1080p 30 frames per second or 60 frames per second yes 60 is there now the audio sounds a little bit scratchy we do have yet again that 96 kilobits per second audio bitrate uh they've gone back to that now and then the rear camera this is our 50 megapixel sand so you can shoot 4K quality doesn't seem to be quite as good as their phones but for a tablet it's not too bad here the focus seems to be fine no real issues with it and it does have electronic image stabilization so just like the front facing camera you can see that the focus yeah no problems with it so not bad video quality for a tablet so xiaomi has done a lot of things right with this model so first off I've got to mention it is finally finally finally yes we have video out via the type C port and USB 3.2 it's only five gigabits per second but hey I'll take that over USB 2 specs any day so the screen IPS it does show a little bit of dark edges around the corners but overall it's not a bad screen super responsive to touch and I think most people are going to be very happy with it it doesn't have any flickering or any of those problems you get with oleds or amoleds 144 Hertz and even a 90 Hertz Sweet Spot option performance is fantastic the Chinese rhyme here while it only has English and Chinese it's really well optimized none of that little spinning loading the UI icons no none of that it's just spot on performance is great and it seems to be bug free which is a rarity especially when I review the global ROMs of MIUI but no this one is fantastic build quality fantastic very good great loudspeakers really good performance for gamers out there and then the loudspeakers they are also impressive and it will fully charge in just over an hour for me around about an hour and eight minutes we'll charge the 8 600 milliamp hour batteries it takes so many boxes but it's not Global no micro SD card no 3.5 millimeter headphone jack sadly and it does not have 5G or 4G support pricing of the global version if we get it I hope it's closer to the Chinese pricing but it'll likely be quite a bit higher so thank you so much for watching my review here of this fantastic Android 13 tablet from xiaomi the xiaomi pad 6 ProLast year when the Xiaomi Pad arrived, it kind of spiced things up in the Android tablet market and now this is here. This is the new Xiaomi Pad 6 and what's interesting, is that this brings some nice upgrades while keeping a killer price. Let me show you. First off, the Xiaomi Pad 6 has a more premium design now. Unlike the plastic back in the last gen, the Pad 6 has an all metal design, be it the back, the frame and this is a tablet that feels very high-end. It's also sleeker than the Pad 5. It's 20 grams lighter at 490 grams, it's 0.34mm slimmer at 6.51mm and ya, this looks and feels better. Now, functionality-wise, this has these magnetic connectors for the upgraded pen and the keyboard. The buttons are clicky and nice. There are still quad speakers here with hi-res audio and Dolby Atmos support and these speakers are still room-filling and awesome. Now, the Pad 6, just like the last gen, does not have a fingerprint scanner, there's just face unlock and there's also no microSD slot, no headphone jack, no LTE variant. But there's one upgrade that I honestly did not expect. I'm talking about the fact that the USB-C port here is USB 3.2. Now to give you an idea, even the higher priced OnePlus Pad has a USB 2.0 port. Now if you're wondering what difference does this make, well, for starters, the USB 3.2 port brings faster data transfer speeds. See, I copied the same 8GB file from an SSD to Xiaomi Pad 6 and the OnePlus Pad and on the Xiaomi Pad 6, the file was copied in 48 seconds, while the OnePlus Pad, it took 5 minutes 24 seconds. That is a huge difference. That's not all, the USB 3.2 port here means that you can connect this tablet to a 4K display or a 4K TV using an HDMI to Type-C cable and that's actually pretty useful. Anyway, coming back to the expected upgrades, the display is still 11 inches but it's higher res at 2.8K, it has a faster refresh rate at 144Hz and slightly brighter at 550 nits. Now, I really liked the display on the last gen Xiaomi Pad and this is slightly better. Videos look great on this panel, be it the colors, the contrast and since this has a 16:10 inch aspect ratio, there isn't a lot of letterboxing in movies and shows. The display is also good to use in outdoorish situations. Look, this display is great but I wouldn't say it has changed a lot. Yes, it has the 144Hz refresh rate, but most of the time, the UI is locked to 120Hz and when you play videos, it goes to 60Hz or 30Hz depending on the video, and it's only supported games that you get the full 144Hz refresh rate experience. Now, one of the things that I really liked about the Xiaomi Pad 5 was the MIUI for pad experience and I like that on the Pad 6, Xiaomi hasn't changed a lot of things. First of all, this has MIUI 14 based on Android 13 and I like that there's absolutely no bloatware, here just like the Pad 5. This is the home screen after I set up the tablet for the first time and apart from Netflix, there's no bloatware whatsoever. It's a clean experience. Apart from that, I also noticed no ads, so it's really good and I like that there's all the features, I liked on the Pad 5. You get the nice dual pane UI in most apps, you get the same useful dock here that is available everywhere and lets you drag and drop apps to split screen, put apps in a floating window. It's very very useful and I like that you can save app pairs now to launch them side by side quickly. There's also this gesture to put an app into split screen. Now, there is one interesting new feature, I'm talking about this continue task feature which is like continuity on iPads and iPhones, but this is in beta and limited to Xiaomi 13 Pro which we don't have right now, so ya. Now, one area where I'm a little doubtful is updates. See, Xiaomi has promised 3 years of security patches for the Xiaomi Pad 6 and that's fine, but there's no word on OS updates which is a little strange. Anyway, what's not strange is that the Pad 6 gets a processor upgrade. The new Pad 6 is powered by the Snapdragon 870 processor which is a good upgrade to the 860 and the RAM is also now LPDDR5 and the storage is UFS 3.1. Now, these upgraded specs show in the higher benchmark scores of the tablet, be it Antutu or Geekbench and I really like the performance here. I mean, you already saw how smooth the tablet was when using the dock, the split screen gestures and even gaming is very good. Games like Asphalt run very well and I liked that games like BGMI run on the highest graphics settings and gameplay is mostly smooth and good. The accessories too have gotten slight upgrades. First of all, Xiaomi has promised that these will be available to buy, unlike the last time when it just wasn't available. And second, like I said, they have gotten some improvements. The new Xiaomi smart pen looks and feels the same. It has the same two buttons that let you quickly take a note, change the pen style, change the pen color. You can also press hold on this to take a screenshot like this. Now, this is all good, but what's insane is that the new pen has a rated battery life of 150 hours compared to 8 hours on the last gen. I have no idea how Xiaomi is doing this. Also, it charges magnetically on the tablet and one minute of charge is set to bring 7 hours of backup. I know, crazy. That's not all, the latency has also been improved and honestly, this is really good to use. The Xiaomi keyboard remains the same. It attaches magnetically and it has nice travel in the keys and it has support for useful keyboard shortcuts. You can even create custom shortcuts, but ya, a touchpad built into this would be obviously better. Now, apart from all this, the rear camera remains the same 13MP sensor, which takes fine photos. The front camera also remains the same 8MP ultra wide angle camera. And it is pretty good for calls in classes, especially with the four mics. The battery is slightly bigger at 8,840mAh battery, and you get the same 33W fast charger. Now, the battery life is pretty good. We got a screen time of 6 hours with 11% battery left, and that is with the screen set to Max brightness. The keyboard attached all the time and that is with heavy usage. So that's pretty good. The charging speed is also pretty good. The 33W charger takes the tablet to 50% in around 45 minutes and fully charges it in 1 hour 43 minutes, which is fine for a tablet. Look, let's face it, the Xiaomi Pad 5 was still a very good tablet under 30K, but now the Xiaomi Pad 6 is here. And this brings some nice upgrades, making things even better. But what's really awesome is that Xiaomi has kept the same killer pricing as last year. Honestly, at a starting price of Rs 26,999/-, this is the ultimate value for money Android tablet. Yes, there's still no LTE variant. Xiaomi hasn't really clarified on the OS updates. But even with all this, this is the absolute best Android tablet under 30K. Anyway, I want to know from you guys, what do you think of the Xiaomi Pad 6 and this pricing? Comment down below and thanks for watching.so this time around this is the xiaomi pad 6 Pro this is the pro variant 6 series the xiaomi pad and by far uh globally and I do hope so this is probably one of the most powerful uh tablet I've ever had experienced it [Music] so you have a pretty white box over here and what I got here is the 12 gigs of RAM and 256g of storage and the color is black so let's unbox so let's open the box so pretty nice packaging this time around so yeah and yeah I'll try the pad is quite light I kind of like the packaging this time around remember this design looks like the xiaomi 13 Pro looks like a charging terminal to me and the xiaomi logos here so we have the volume rocker over here a microphone here this one seems to be a magnet for xiaomi pen so underneath you have dual speakers over here a microphone and of course your type c port on this side it's pretty clean two more speakers over here and the power button and it's being powered by Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos so some more other stuff inside the box we have your user guide type c cable 67 watts of fast charging great First Time xiaomi Pad 6 Pro and what's nice Tito Scania is quite large younger than screen and of course this one has a very nice display another takeaway this is a tablet is this one is being powered by Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos so definitely the enjoyment details entertainment is has one of the most powerful the processor I've seen in a tablet so this one has the Snapdragon 8 plus gen one and by Fara I'm really impressed performance mind-blowing us Benchmark 1.29 million points so once I predictor must score this is what you can see and I is about split screenshot checking other Benchmark like 3D Mark and eternavascript under thermal throttling test for 20 minutes and you know Auto for four straight times score it has throttle to 92 percent all green so for sure this one can perform really really well even it's a gaming tablet is an 11 incher IPS LCD 144hz screen refresh rate hdr10 plus support and I'm gonna maximum brightness detail is at 500 15 minutes this one is being protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Sahara browsing on social media looks something like this thanks smooth yeah guys to be honest with you probably one of the smoothest tones for a tablet so if you're browsing the maditas of Facebook equally nice smooth smooth scrolling as long as you have a very stable internet connection I don't think so this is kind of refresh rate either you can use 1690 or 144 or 40 I would highly suggest it Turtles AI image has a massive 8600 milliampere hours of battery quite larger and what's surprisingly though is this one is weighing at around 490 grams it's quite light for a tablet of this size for 67 watts of fast charging and charging from 10 to 100 ticks an hour and 20 minutes now if you ask me did last a whole day on normal usage yes Call of Duty mobile and playing this game I would say in a so Bronx smooth uh gameplay and I can still kind of touch response is also good as a big screen while playing I would highly recommend a comma controller but uh but holding this one game play but the experience is definitely pretty solid technically so I was able to enjoy honestly unlocking the screen and why the screen nice and of course some kind of sound is really enjoyable this one has a 50 MP the rear camera sensor together with a 2mp and depth sensor it can shoot up to 4K and 16.20 MP in a front-facing camera which can shoot up to 1080P and 60 FPS now picture using my tablets is for demonstration purpose and I was able to take some really nice snap on outdoor condition tablet that has a very nice camera just like this one imagine on Gundam and bring it indoors it was able to snap in some really nice one as well and even though the major low light okay and to be honest with you can confrontation camera I was able to snap in some really nice one it's an outdoor condition and indoor conditions using the front station camera [Music] only so right now I'm sitting indoors at 1080P and 60 FPS and I can see that this camera is really capable probably one of the best on the title on any tablet under your camera is one of the best things so check it out xiaomi part 6 Pro using the rear camera so guys I can see I'm camera NATO foreign 256 is priced at 27 000 pesos link on the

second generation [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] xiaomi pad 6 is a great tablet for both productivity and entertainment it has large 11 inch display with 144h cinematic display makes the display very smooth and fluid Dolby Vision support can produce stunning visuals with more contrast and deeper blacks this makes it perfect for watching movies or TV shows that were created with Dolby vision in mind it's only 6.5 mm in thickness and weighs just 490 grams in spite of its metal body which makes it easy to hold in one hand 165.18 wide and 253.95 mm tall this makes it comfortable to hold in landscape mode for watching videos or playing games xiaomi pad 6 equipped with a powerful Snapdragon 870 processor and a long lasting battery with 8800 mAh battery that is three watt fast charging included in the box and USB type A to type c cable with xiaomi claims that it can charge 100 in just 100 minutes and pan 6 comes with lpddr5 ram and in two variant that is 6 JB of Ram with 128 GB and 8 GB of RAM with 256 GB of storage and coming to build and design the xiaomi pad 6 has 4 speakers 2 on top and two at the bottom with the support of Dolby Atmos that can produce immersive audio that surrounds you power button on the top volume rockers on the right and One mic here and this is the magnetic slot to charge and hold xiaomi pen 2 which we will get to see details in a minute and here another my and at the bottom there are two speakers and type c and here another mic and on the left side it's completely planed with a complete magnetic bezel to attach with xiaomi keyboard and also works as a stand as well friend sign an 8 megapixel camera placed at the center of the device in landscape mode which is a perfect place while having video calls and this is how the video and audio quality with 1080p with 30 FPS and which is quite okay for taking video calls and on the back side you get a 13 megapixel camera with flashlight and this is a dummy slot just to keep the design more elegant and look like an iPad Pro and here are some of the samples taken with rear camera and xiaomi Pad 6 is available in two colors which is graphite gray and Mist Blue and also xiaomi pad 6 supports bigger screens add HDMI to type c cable with the support you can convert your monitor into a smart TV and enjoy 4K videos with 60 FPS not only that this is really helpful when you want to present anything from the tablet on a bigger screen and also xiaomi pad 6 has one unique feature that is Smartphone Link in which you can just drag and drop a photos from your phone to xiaomi pad 6 but this is really restricted to only xiaomi phones and hopefully xiaomi will extend these features to other phones as well when it comes to tablets we really focus on the software rather than on the hardware and we want our tablets to be run smooth fluid no Jitters and no lag while playing games or watching movies we also want a tablet that can handle multitasking without any problem but this time xiaomi taking a different approach they are not only focusing on the software but they are also providing a specific Hardware accessories that can enhance the tablet experience and this is a great move by xiaomi this shows that they are really thinking about the user experience to make it better this keyboard case from xiaomi attaches to this three pin due to which there is no need for Paving and you can start typing immediately keys are nice and smooth and the build quality is premium and feels like a leather shortcuts like text selection by holding shift key copy and paste move between screens Escape all works like a regular keyboard if you want a proper tablet experience you can detach in a second and you are good to go but the keyboard with a tracking pad would have been given even a better experience this brings to our next accessory that is xiaomi pen second generation xiaomi pen second generation has matte finish nice grip it can be attached to xiaomi pad 6 on top like this get this little quick pop-up showing the battery percentage and xiaomi claims this with one charge it can last up to 150 hours of battery and it has two buttons If you long press the back button you can take a screenshot if you long press the front button you can take a quick notes and within the notes you can move around the pens by clicking the front button and you can choose the Colors by clicking the back buttons and it has a 4096 level pressure sensitivity by applying gentle pressure you get a thin line as you press harder you get the darker and wider line and here you can write notes do your creative stuff like painting drawing sketches but the keyboard comes at rupees 4999 which is a bit expensive with this cost I would have expected easily a trackpad and a pen cost 599 this is also I feel a bit expensive they must have included some other functionalities like gesture functionalities and all at this cost and we will definitely have a another detailed review because there are more to talk on these accessories in a separate video and one of the main purpose of a tablet is multitasking and quick accessing of the tools for example if you are working on a productivity tool and you need to calculate something you can just swipe up either of these sides take the calculator and leave on the screen which works like a floating window after it's used you can just drag to either of these edges of the tablet to minimize similarly if you are watching a tutorial on YouTube and you want to take a quick note you can swipe up and drag the note app to either of it just will do one and also you can slide this left and right to make it decal small screen as per your convenience and the best part is until you close windows it saves the split windows in the memory and you can access them again with a single touch and when it comes to gaming xiaomi pad 6 with the Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos sound with the quad speakers which will give you an immersive experience of gaming and we have texted with Asphalt 9 dbmi use sniper I didn't find even a single thing drop while playing speakers will give you an immersive experience to a level but dgmi and pure sniper were running on 144hz and as part 9 was always running on 60hz though the tablet is for 144 has display but the majority of the use I have seen it's ranging from only 60 to 120 heads only even if I that the 144 heads display but this is not expected because xiaomi advertises a lot on 144 has display but majority of the time I haven't seen 144 heads but the xiaomi pad 6 is available only in Wi-Fi variant and it is available in India at 26 triple 9. overall this budget friendly Rich feature tablet coupled with accessories will definitely enhance your productivity and make your entertainment experience better and all the links are in the below description and if you want a case without any keyboard then you can go for this this has also have a pen stand here and if you are using not using then there is a stand also like this you can keep it this is comes around 800 which is is good it feels leather but keyboard will give you a better experience if you are more of productivity purpose if you are buying a tablet please let me know in the comments below section about your thoughts on this tablet please like share and subscribe to get more stuff like this thanks for watching and catch you in the next video foreignxiaomi Patrick is it an iPad on a budget I won't bore you with this specifications let's just get straight to the point you can pause the video right now if you're into the specs part but now let me share my experience with you I'll be honest I was very skeptical at first especially when I saw the xiaomi smart pen it wasn't really a surprise that they were going for the iPad yesterday xiaomi has been known for delivering high quality products at a fraction of a price the xiaomi pad 6 is again no such exception to that it's been touted as the budget friendly alternative to the iPad but can it really hold its own against the Apple's Powerhouse in case you are new over here hey guys my name is I'm an electronic music producer a part-time gamer and I also try to make videos considering the price point the path 6 really looks premium it has an all metal finish at the back and at the sides from the back it really has an iPad like white to be honest I've been using the iPad Pro for many years now when I held this in my hand for the first time my first reaction was I really like the size of it it's more reasonable and it makes more sense for day-to-day travel it just really feels great in my hands to be honest unlike my iPad I've been using this tablet vertically I did a lot of reading on the pad six beat scrolling Twitter or threads or even reading articles on medium or something on Kindle I really enjoyed the form factor and it was very comfortable to hold on even for long reading sessions it's an 11 inch 144hz display thereby making it super smooth the viewing experience is thereby really nice you can binge watch your favorite Netflix shows for hours although I don't recommend that you do that speaking of ours it really has a great battery life no cap I was out for a couple of days and it kept lying down in my drawer when I came back after two days I was really amazed because it still had 90 of battery left xiaomi was somehow able to manage the idle time really nicely it's also for the fact that it has a gigantic 8840 mAh battery I was able to get about six to seven hours of screen on time on single charge while actively using it I kept playing Asphalt 9 and Rand geekbench 6 again and again in order to test it out these were the geekbench scores by the way for somewhat of a moderate usage it can actually last more than an entire day to be honest out of the box it's running on Android 13 with the MIUI skin on top of it xiaomi has taken every single measure they can in order to make the pad 6 feel like the iPad when you unlock the tab it clearly looks similar to iPad take a close look at the icons all the apps have been adjusted to the infamous rounded rectangles rather the default wallpaper was also very similar MIUI like always has a bit of bloatware and unnecessary apps that you'll never use the dock was actually really convenient it slides up very smoothly you can just drag and drop apps from the dock to start the split screen multitasking you can even add shortcuts to your frequently used multitask windows so that's really neat out there I was able to take handwritten notes while reading articles on medium it ran smoothly and I faced no lag or any such issues one thing I like to point out is that the type C Port is actually a USB 3.2 Port you can transfer files real smooth and it will definitely be a lot more faster it has Dolby Atmos and a total of four speakers two at the top and two at the bottom the sound was balanced it artificially did not increase the highs like most other tablets do I even did some good amount of gaming as well I mostly played Asphalt 9 and beach buggy racing and a little bit of Minecraft by the way the Snapdragon 870 chip was able to handle that very well and to be honest it didn't have much heating issues xiaomi actually has a record of heating devices so I was surprised to see this if you are planning to take selfies using the patch 6 my advice for you is please don't take selfies the front camera is an absolute potato potato if you were planning to attend meetings or even your online classes using this although the positioning of the front camera was ideal for doing video calls as it was on the horizontal bezel but sadly it just wasn't there I'll let you decide for yourself so this is my front camera footage when I'm actually standing next to my softbox and my setup but when I just move across the room you can already see a lot of grains happening everywhere and yeah I don't recommend that you use your front camera much to record videos first it's gonna give you very average results to be honest the back camera was however reasonable so this is how the back camera looks in daylight it's good enough to be honest and if you have a well-lit environment this can actually give you some decent results I'm currently recording our 4K 30 FPS I obviously did not expect it to have a flagship level camera but yeah it did a great job considering it's just a tablet and people mostly won't be using it to take photos maybe a few scans or some random snaps overall if you want to click a photo randomly then you'll be able to get some okay results using this it's a 13 megapixel camera by the way now let's talk about the xiaomi smart pin the pen was actually very pricey in comparison so I was really curious about it first things first the pen really has a great battery life I haven't seen it below 99 percent even for once the pen has two physical buttons one opens up the quick note section and the other one opens up the screenshot utility you will be able to select the region you want to take a snapshot of it also snaps magnetically on the side of the tab not the best one though it kept falling even with the slightest touch this was really disappointing as I dropped my smart pen a lot of times multiple times and a lot of times and multiple times this is how it stands compared to the apple pencil the apple pencil is a teeny bit taller and also has a broader tip compared to the xiaomi smart pen the writing experience was nice actually the pressure sensitivity feels a bit weird since I've switched from the apple pencil you just need to get used to it to be honest if you're gonna use a pen like stylus for the first time then you won't face any issue you can get used to it quite comfortably the riding experience was great overall I did not face any issues while taking notes it was a rather smooth experience but I did not like the writing experience on the default Notes app of the xiaomi pad 6. it really felt slow and stuttery it was like a cheap replica of Apple notes to be honest for this one I was actually using this really cool app called Nebo I also tried out some digital art I was sketching some random comics and doodles I actually liked how it felt overall was really comfortable and I did not miss my apple pencil at all for the price I can highly recommend it if you want to get started doing digital art xiaomi also claims that the xiaomi pen charges from 0 to 100 in just 18 minutes you can also attach a keyboard at the back using the magnetic pins I only got the xiaomi pen I'll leave a link of the keyboard as well in case you might be interested in that and I almost forgot to mention you get a 33 watt charger right out of the box this was a actually after a while that I purchased something and I got a charger along with it let's talk about the price now it cost 26 triple nine in India and US pricing is about 400 the smart pen however cost five triple nine in India and I'm not really sure about the US pricing because it's not available on Amazon us at this moment while I was recording this video but I read an article somewhere that it costs around 130 US dollars if you want to buy the pad 6 I highly recommend that you get it you probably won't get a better Android tablet in this price point if you want to buy the pen as well it will cost you a total of 530 US dollars so that's something you must think about well if you ask me I feel that the price could have been a little bit lower selling with the price of the pad six it is what it is but if you plan to buy it then please go ahead as I really like the performance so is the xiaomi pad 6 really an iPad on a budget in many ways yes it offers a solid performance and a great display and has a Sleek design all of these at a fraction of a price of the iPad if you are looking for a budget friendly Android tablet that does not compromise on performance then the xiaomi path 6 is definitely worth considering do let me know your thoughts in the comments and if you wanted to check out the best and Road apps that would help you stay productive then click here please consider subscribing to my channel and I hope to see you there [Music] baby when you look at methe number one selling foreign shall I remind you we give you valuable products budgeting for example me pad five Snapdragon 860. 120 hertz in the display committee aspects career um foreign foreign foreign as you guys know this is xiaomi pad six uh one of the latest item from xiaomi pads and I would want to say that this is one of the best product xiaomi have ever put out in India foreign so this is definitely a good uh item and yeah and I think that they have changed ladies and gentlemen so let's just unbox this is produced 33 watts in the charger type A to type 0 power delivery so we have the xiaomi pad six Snapdragon 870 up to 3.2 gigahertz in uh who protect your consumer right keep this label intact okay um ladies and gentlemen this is xiaomi pad 6. so let's just look at it this is foreign foreign great thing actually let's check the sound quality comparing to the other tab but uh speakers [Applause] so yeah good speaker very nice vibrant display uh 144 Hertz on a very smooth case foreign back face is xiaomi pad 6 keyboard yes stand like this oh minute I PM so multitasking is split screen so Snapdragon day 870 chips we have one more thing oh previous generations tap to connect tutorial screenshot press and hold the screenshot button to take and edit a screenshot oh nice you can literally use this to navigate foreign [Laughter] you can do this you can select and you can draw it this is one of the best especially sensitive but still foreign but xiaomi paddling navigation menu this is a basic thing you should do with something like this foreign I don't know screenshots on an emergency situation tablet really works and this is a powerful tablet eight seven years so performance it will be really nice in this product is another video so till then I think this is definitely a good product from xiaomi oh by the way very important yes you know that is actually a great thing for 128 you are getting this for 27 000 icic card online discount so 23 000 oh my God for that price this is gone uh shortcuts definitely a good upgrade from the last year previous generation xiaomi is going to rule again and you get a proper tab UI and everything so face ID face unlock very good display uh but very good display 144 Hertz mighty one plus some one for 144 hertzana and I already benefit for OnePlus is 67 watts in a fast charging you know 33 Watts on window but other than that I think for the price this product is awesome foreign [Laughter]so OnePlus made a tablet and I made a quick short explaining it and immediately there are a bunch of comments like oh please this is worth a full video please make a full video on this please elaborate on this so now that's what I'm doing so I really get to explain what they've done see tablets haven't really changed much over the past couple years feels like we've kind of settled if you will into this sort of hierarchy where especially in the US iPads are so popular that it's basically just iPads and everything else and I've even had conversations recently with some friends about this which is just like they straight up won't switch from the iPad like no matter how good of a competitor comes up it can be amazing Hardware it can be the best screen the best battery in the world it's an amazing tablet but it still wouldn't be an iPad which is the iMessage and the FaceTime and all the things that plug into the ecosystem of iPad and apple world so making an Android tablet that can actually take users from the iPad is clearly an uphill battle but hey if you're gonna try you might as well have some strategy to it and so OnePlus has three so strategy number one copying the iPad so look just to be clear I understand there's only so many ways to make a rectangular computer there's only so many ways to make a tablet uh and I actually don't mind when products copy each other as long as they copy the good stuff that being said yeah they've ripped some stuff straight from the iPad now it does have its own unique Hardware aesthetic you got to give them that it's a different shape and a different color and of course it's a different layout with a bunch of OnePlus and Android features that really suggest more holding it in landscape unlike the iPads which feel a bit more interchangeable but they weren't shy about some things like this pencil this is the apple pencil and this is the new OnePlus pencil same shape same size same pressure sensitive tip which is nice same single flat side which prevents it from Rolling away on a table which is smart but then same slapping onto the side of a tablet with magnets and charging it by inductive wireless charging so you don't lose it it's convenient it even has the same little animation to show you when you've paired it and how much battery percentage you have there are probably other ways to do this but you know the result is just a very familiar experience with a nice finely controlled pressure sensitive pointing device for navigating around and swiping and even typing and of course all the drawing and note taking you possibly want they've also made a magnetic keyboard accessory with a trackpad that can connects to the tablet with magnets and these pins and turns it into a whole lappable Android 11 inch laptop alternative it might not completely float the tablet above the keyboard like the heavier less lappable one from Apple but it does use basically the exact same cursor mechanism as the iPad where you can swipe around with this dark circle and then it snaps onto different touch targets As you move near them again a pretty great thing to copy it's got quad speakers in the same four spots as the iPad Pro it's even got this Ultra wide camera at the front that has a software feature that can move around as you walk around and keep you in the center of the frame it's not called Center Stage though it's called Limelight the point is there's a ton of stuff here where if you're going to take people away from the iPad you gotta at least make them feel at home so then strategy number two undercutting the iPad this one's pretty simple the iPad line is already pretty expensive so probably the most compelling thing you can do to get someone to consider an alternative is to be cheaper than the iPad so iPad Air I think that's a pretty good comp iPad Air starts right now with the newest one at 5.99 and that's the 64 gig version this tablet as we mentioned pretty fairly priced 479 and that's 128 gig so you can see it's a pretty good start but you have to be careful because in order to get to that price you have to trim just the right set of things that people hopefully don't notice too much so this tablet is running a mediatek demensity 9000 chip which benchmarks similar to the Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 which is about 50 beneath the more expensive Flagship Snapdragon 8 gen 2. honestly most of the time not noticeable but if you are going to ask it some more demanding things especially like gaming then you will feel that this is not the highest end chip there is also no fingerprint reader which is fine but there's also no extra infrared or depth sensors it's just straight up facial recognition with the standard RGB selfie camera and for some reason my face has to be really close to it to unlock it's just picky enough to get slightly annoying sometimes and then this display doesn't quite get as bright it maxes out at 500 nits so it limits your outdoor usability for sure and then this keyboard case which is optional it's actually noticeably cheaper than Apples too it's actually 149 so it's literally half the price of the magic keyboard but also it's not back lit it doesn't float the tablet or anything it's also less premium feeling material so it's more in line with the smart folio case which is still 179 but really the most interesting strategy strategy number three is one-upping the iPad there are some things they've done with this tablet that are objectively better than any iPad okay so here we go first of all this is an 11.5 inch display with a unique slightly tall seven by five aspect ratio and slightly thinner bezels on the iPad but you know what's straight up better than any iPad it's 144 Hertz refresh rate granted that's only slightly higher than 120 hertz iPad Pro but for 479 I mean you're more in line with the 60 hertz iPad Air and I'm a sucker for a high refresh rate display and I do notice the difference in a few key places like scrolling around browsing in Chrome and drawing with the pen but more on that in a second the ultra wide front facing camera is on the landscape bezel that's also better than almost every iPad except for the newest cheap one so anytime you're on a video call you actually sit in the middle of the frame not kind of awkwardly off to one side it also is an objectively better battery than any iPad this is a 9 500 10 milliamp hour battery that's iPad Pro sized and combined with the chip has Rock Solid battery life and very good standby time and it charges much faster than any iPad it's got 67 watt supervook charging so most of the tablet using world is going to be used to the iPad's kind of slow 30 watts of charging this one can charge from zero to 100 in an hour and a half with the charger that's included in the box and then there's also this whole special features section in the settings where they've tucked these nice clever little enhancements mostly to do with the multitasking experience so I'm not even going to remind you of the disaster that is stage manager on the iPad that's still kind of rough but on the OnePlus pad you can do things like drag two fingers down from the middle of the screen to slice your app in half and initiate split screen multitasking with apps that support it and then there's three different window sizes that it supports and you can switch those around there's also a smart side bar that kind of slides out from the top right where it's this hidden dock so you can put your favorite apps in there or some quick shortcuts to grab whatever you want or just open up the list of all your apps again so lots of good stuff in here right even they've even got some little ecosystem stuff going on since OnePlus makes phones you can do data sharing with another OnePlus phone super easily there's a lot but this is still an Android tablet which means a lot of things it means of course that there is no FaceTime iMessage all the ecosystem stuff that comes that Apple people like obviously but that also means the app situation is still not what you want it to be like when I say apps that support it with multitasking that's a pretty small list like there's just very few good well-optimized Android tablet apps even today in 2023 it also means that the 144hz capable display is rarely actually uh refreshing at 144hz it's often at 120 hertz or even 60 hertz depending on the app support again uh and that sort of means you only really get the extra stuff when you're scrolling around the UI or web browsing or in the settings app basically and not while gaming it also means the cameras are meh so you see the the camera is sort of in this unique layout in the middle it's a 13 megapixel camera on the back but the photos it takes are pretty mid not that a tablet is like some photography machine it's mostly for video calls but even this is pretty grainy it has this like splotching even in a well-lit environment not great and then for the arguably even more important selfie camera it's it's mostly for video calls and so it should look pretty decent this is perfect lighting and even in these dark shadows you can see some weird noise artifacts and splotching and and this over here it it's 1080P and it's it's fine it's probably fine but in Limelight mode when it's doing the ultra wide and hunting around it looks worse than this too and it also means that Android 14 is on the horizon so that will probably improve a lot of the multitasking stuff we just saw but this one's going to launch with Android 13. so if you get one it'll have Android 13 and never buy a product based on potential future software updates so as of right now it's an Android 13 tablet so OnePlus has made a good tablet for a good price I think a lot of people consider this a bargain f479 for the 128 gigs but because of this data tablets it feels like they're up against some impossible task like this is the same thing that happened to Samsung's Ultra tablet remember the video I made on the ultra the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra tried something super super high end and honestly in the hardware and design department they really beat the iPad in a lot of ways they made an incredible piece but same question where is it now I think the same place as this some people are going to buy it and they're going to be pretty happy with it and those people knew exactly what they were getting into and it's a tough task taking tablet buyers from the iPad thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] foreign [Music]\n",

      "okay so I've made a short on this and I've made videos about these Monster tablets in the past and every single time people get really into them and I'm really into them but the question that always keeps coming up every time is are these actually iPad Killers like is an iPad killer a real thing so let's talk about it this is the newest highest end Android Tablet from Samsung the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra and it's even more ridiculous than the previous year's already crazy Ultra and I love it so I've already made a video on the tab S7 plus and then last year the tab S8 Ultra if you haven't already seen that I'll link it below that was last year's version and so now just like the rest of Samsung's recent announcements this new one mostly looks the same as last year's version but all the changes they've made are in the same direction just making it even more capable so you've got this gigantic 14.6 inch tablet that I mean it feels like I'm holding a small TV in my hands it somehow also razor thin with a huge battery inside and it actually doesn't snap in half despite looking like it probably should be susceptible to that but hey watch The X video for yourself if you don't believe me it survives better than a lot of other devices have this year though a new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy inside plus a new Vapor chamber cooling system under the hood so there's going to be an even higher ceiling for performance for everything it's already good at we've seen this thing do multitasking well for years and be quick to scroll around and open and close apps with normal usage and now it'll do better at gaming and video editing and potentially also last a bit longer on that same 11 200 milliamp hour battery that's bigger than any battery that's ever been in an iPad this year the quad speaker setup is also now made up of 20 larger speakers which is a pretty big jump and I'm not ready to call these the best sounding speakers in any tablet quite yet that's still that goes to the iPad Pro still but these sure do get really loud with very little Distortion and you can flip on Dolby Atmos audio if you want some pretty impressive surround sound effects for music or videos or games and then this entire tablet is now ip68 water and dust resistant for the first time which means it's safe to not just splash it with water but literally completely submerge the whole thing underwater and it'll be totally fine which is crazy I don't know any situation where you would end up with a tablet underwater maybe you're recklessly watching Netflix next to a pool or something and then you drop it in I don't know that but if you did it will still be fine but then on top of that this S Pen also comes in the Box again and this thing also now has an ip68 rating of its own and it also now supports bi-directional charging but not the bi-directional charging you're probably thinking of when you can accept charge from the tablet but also charge other things no I just mean whatever Direction the pen faces when you magnetize it to the back of the tablet it will work and charge perfectly fine which is better than last year what I'm surprised doesn't come in the box is any charging brick I mean for a tablet that does everything this thing is actually capable of 45 watt charging which is really solid but the only way to get that is to buy a charger something like this anchor Prime desktop charger which I would totally get over any Samsung first party charger because it's gallium nitride it's smaller and then it also has multi-port charging up to 240 Watts Max output so you could literally charge a laptop full speed and the tablet full speed at the same time but then of course they also make a really convenient battery Bank option so this this is the anchor Prime 250 watt battery bank with two USBC ports and one USB a port it has a built-in inductive wireless charging pad so that can charge the battery Bank up to 100 watts and then there's an app connected to it that lets you configure the display and optimize charging or even play a sound to find it it's way more advanced than any charger that's ever come in any Samsung bucks so shout out to anchor for sponsoring this video and I'll put a link in the description for you to check this one out right below that like button but the point is I mean you've seen all the specs now they're all huge numbers it's a 14 and a half inch screen in my hands it's 120 hertz it's an 11 200 milliamp hour battery it's quad speakers it's the minimum 12 gigs of RAM it's a terabyte of internal storage with up to another terabyte of micro SD card storage all these numbers are great but it's actually using this tablet and actually holding it it's it's hard to describe it to you but it's even more hilariously fun so I'm personally partial to like media idea consumption on devices like this like I would just want to watch YouTube videos on a gigantic screen take them with me download them offline watch them on flights with my free time like it's already amazing for that and honestly I think that's what most people do on tablets a lot of the time but of course for all the additional stuff that tablet power users are going to be doing there is just so much more that this thing is capable of basically it's at the Forefront of tablets there's all of Samsung's multi-window multitasking features and pop-up windows on that 16x10 aspect ratio display all of the stylus features which if you want to use a stylus on a tablet it feels like Samsung and Apple are really the only ones taking it seriously but you know I'm using it to sign documents every once in a while but there are some people whose entire workflows go through this thing and then you can't forget about decks there's a whole clever keyboard folio case that I didn't even have here for this one but I had it for the S8 Ultra and that adds a whole nother Dimension and Dex mode has been super used useful while giving you that desktop experience with independent windows and you can plug it into an even larger display if you want to it's more powerful than anything Apple has even tried to do on the iPad and all of that isn't even mentioning that this is probably the biggest camera viewfinder anyone has ever used Plus on the front that little Notch up there I've mentioned this before but there's two selfie cameras a front-facing normal camera and an ultra wide that can do auto framing in videos or in video calls similar to what Apple calls Center Stage except these cameras are actually in the right place on the long side of the tablet so all that being said can this be an iPad killer that's the question we keep asking and it's a good it's a real question like this is clearly competing against the iPad Pro the biggest baddest iPad Pro but it's going to have a lot of things a lot of features a lot of numbers to one-up the iPad Pro right it's got a bigger screen it's got bigger speakers it's got external expandable storage it's got the fingerprint reader that the iPad Pro doesn't have and all of that costs a hundred dollars more than the equivalent iPad Pro this reminds me of the conversation we've had about Sony phones like in the world of Android phones Sony is out here making incredibly well-equipped super high-end phones with a ton of Enthusiast features and expandable memory and manual controls that the competition like just straight up doesn't offer and that's only really at the expense of a little bit of automatic mode usability and price like they just they're expensive they cost more and while it's really easy to point out all the obvious benefits and advantages to all these extra features and these cool things that it does it turns out that the number of people who will actually take advantage of these features is Tiny and I mean they're everywhere on YouTube but when it comes to actually voting with their wallets most people end up just going with the sort of more standard one and I feel like there is a similar phenomenon Happening Here for whatever reason videos about these tablets do numbers they're they're going crazy like people love to see these on video and I like talking about them but then when it comes to actually buying them people uh the the ecosystem effect is way stronger than any uh YouTube comments would suggest people love flocking to the iPad for iMessage and FaceTime and all these other things but to keep it even more simple I like I have this analogy that I really like even better people like bigger screens as long as it doesn't sacrifice too much in the other areas of the device so take the MacBook Air for example that 13-inch MacBook Air was one of the best selling laptops for years it was Apple's number one best-selling laptop for a long time and people wanted a bigger screen but the only way that they could get a bigger screen and still buy an Apple product was to move all the way up to the 16-inch MacBook Pro which was just dramatically more expensive I mean it was Overkill most people did not need that much computer and so people would actually start to drift away and go buy a different slightly bigger screened laptop from some other company so much so that Apple finally this year decided to introduce a larger 15-inch MacBook Air and it turned out that's exactly what people wanted they just want the bigger screen on the other end of this apple tried introducing a mini iPhone for two whole years which you would think is a brilliant idea if you only read YouTube comments but again it turns out most people want the bigger screen and so that ended up not selling enough it got discontinued and today we have a plus phone instead so this is a bigger screen tablet than the iPad Pro which is why it's so amazing and impressive to hold and look at but it's also a very different tablet from the iPad Pro it's 100 bucks more but it's an Android tablet it has a whole different feature set and for a lot of people that's too much sacrifice and a lot of people will continue to just get iPads but for those who are not looped into the ecosystem and who don't depend on these features this is a hell of a tablet thanks for watching catch you in the next one peaceAre you desperate to buy a tablet with a budget of 3 to 4 million? Yes, one of the options that needs to be relayed is the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus tablet which will be released in Indonesia in October 2023 with the Galaxy Tab A9. This could be an option for children and adults. Samsung The Galaxy Tab A9 Plus has experienced many improvements compared to its predecessor, improvements such as support for connectivity 5 and also Dex mod which makes the Mul testing experience even more fun and here are the advantages and disadvantages of the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus which has been done by the Samsung Galaxy Tab [Music] mirango gadget team The A9 Plus doesn't have IP 68 like the Galaxy Tab S9FE series, which is normal considering that the segments it targets are different, but there are three things that make me like the body design on this tablet. The first is the simplicity. The back of the body looks simple without any strange accents. It's strange except for the straight vertical lines on the back cover of the tablet. These lines separate the area made of aluminum and the area made of polycarbonate. The second thing I like about the finish on the back cover of the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus is that it uses a black finish so fingerprints don't stick easily that way. The appearance of this tablet is relatively cleaner because it doesn't look dirty. There are two color variants available, namely Grapid and Navi, both of which use a back cover with a matte finish. The three dimensions of the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus are still okay for a tablet with an 11 inch screen, the thickness is only 6.9 mm with a weight of under 500 GR, to be precise 480 GR for the wi-fi variant and 491 GR for the 5g [Music] variant . The Galaxy Tab A9 Plus has a wider screen than the Galaxy Tab A9. This tablet has an 11 inch 2.3 inch screen. Wider than the Galaxy Tab A9, the panel used is a PLS LCD with full HD resolution plus the color display is not as bright as AMOLED, a number of reviewers are satisfied with the quality of this tablet's screen display. Another specification for the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus screen is support for a touch refresh rate of 90 horz. up to 10 fingers, L1 wdefine certification and also an aspect ratio of 16 Bing. The 10 speakers on the Galaxy Tab A9 plus have a studio configuration with four stereo speakers . also includes Dolp Atmos technology for the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus speakers, the Galaxy T A9 Plus is powered by a Snapdragon 695 chipset or SoC from the Alcom Snapron 95 which has faster performance than the Unioc Tiger T618 which is installed on the Galaxy Tab A8 with each Dragon 695. The Galaxy Tab A9 Plus also has The title of being the first Galaxy A series tablet to support 5G connectivity, this SOC is quite modern because it is made with a 6 nanom manufacturing process, in which there are 8 processor cores, 2 of which use a Corortex A78 micro-architector with a speed of 2.2 GHz. The GPU used is Adreno 619. with a frequency of 950 mhz, there are two memory variants offered by Samsung for the Galaxy Tab A9 plus the first variant is 4/64 GB which supports Wii connectivity and the 8/18 GB variant which has connectivity support. The first variant is suitable for light use for parents who want to give a tablet as a gift. children can choose this variant. However, the 8/128 GB RAM variant will be more attractive for advanced users because the larger RAM also improves the performance of the tablet, especially for multitasking, the storage reaching 128 GB provides a sense of calm when you want to install various applications and save files. So both the 4/64 and 8/128 GB variants are also supported by a micro SD card slot which can be installed with a maximum capacity of 1 TB. There are two cameras embedded in the Galaxy Tab A9 plus, the first is a 5 megapixel front camera and the second is an 8 megapixel rear camera. Both cameras can be used to record video up to 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. The camera is actually not a sector that is highlighted on a tablet because the function of the camera on the tablet is for standard documentation video calls and scanning certain documents, although this is one thing that should be appreciated from This tablet's camera is positioned especially in the front camera position. Yes, the front camera of this tablet occupies the ideal position. The longest bezel layer, aka on the top side, is why it's ideal. The reason is because the tablet will be used more often in landscape [Music] orientation. The Galaxy Tab A9 is quite good to use. multitasking with multi windows capabilities, it can open two applications in split screen and Li applications via floating Windows. This capability is also possessed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 plus, but its multitasking capabilities are much better because it has Samsung Dex support. Yes, the Galaxy Tab 9 plus is a Galaxy Tab tablet. Aseries is the first with Dex mode. Apart from Dex mode, other interesting built-in features in the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus software are the tax bar panel and kids mode. Tax Bar is a shortcut in the bottom area of ​​the screen that will always appear even if you are entering an application. As for the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus comes with Oneui 5.1.1 interface based on Android 13. This tablet is promised to get software support for 4 years. The details are Android upgrade three times and security system updates until the fourth year after [Music] release. The types of physical sensors contained in the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus are fairly complete. it has a compass light proximity accelerometer and also a gyroscope. There are compass and gyroscope sensors so the plus point of this tablet is that the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus is also worthy of being used as a navigation tool because it supports several navigation systems, for example GPS Glonas Void Galileo and SS magic regarding connectivity. The tablet supports WiFi. 5 GHz bluetooth 5.1 but there is no NFC support which is interesting. The Galaxy Tab A9 Plus also comes in a 5G Cellular connectivity variant [Music] Android devices need a minimum of USB 3.0 to be able to support the display . mirroring via wireless via [Music] Wii based on the official Samsung Indonesia page, the sales package for the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus does not come with a charger head. The accessories in this book tablet are the SIM TR ejector and data cable. Only the 25 Watt charger is included only as a bonus and even for those who bought during the promotional period from 27 October to 5 November. Thank you for watching this video. Don't forget to subscribe and activate the bell to get interesting information about the best comms from my gadget.- Okay, so you've got about 300 bucks, you are looking for a new tablet, and you're asking yourself, \"Which one is actually better, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 or the entry-level iPad 9?\" When we look at the design, we immediately see some important differences. The iPad 9 still has the older style design with larger bezels on the top and the bottom and a Home button. In contrast, the Tab 8 has a more modern design with smaller bezels all the way around, which give it a cleaner look. It also means that although both tablets are about the same size, we're getting a larger 10.5-inch display on the Tab A8 versus 10.2 inches on the iPad 9. Now, looking around the edges, both tablets have power buttons, volume controls, and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, which I'll come back to later on. For charging and accessories, the iPad 9 still uses the older Lightning port while the Tab A8 uses a USB-C port. Now, personally, I'm stuck with both types of cables because my iPhone, my 3rd Generation AirPods, and even my AirPods Max still use a Lightning cable. And at the same time, my Fold 3, all my Galaxy Tablets, my Buds Live, my Galaxy Book 360, and my MacBooks all use USB-C. So I'm gonna have both types of cables all over the house regardless. So for me, it doesn't really make a difference. But if all your other devices use USB-C, keep in mind that you'll need a dedicated cable for the iPad 9. And in general, USB-C is a more powerful and more versatile port. Now, another advantage of the Tab A8 is that it has a microSD card slot, which allows you to expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. Now, this is great if you wanna keep a ton of photo and video files on your tablet, but keep in mind that this storage is essentially only used for files and not for apps. It's still a factor because the files that you store on the microSD card aren't taking up any of your internal storage, whereas on the iPad 9, everything including photos and video has to be stored locally. Finally, the Tab A8 has 4 speakers versus only 2 on the iPad 9. And there are some significant implications to this, which I'll cover in the gaming section. All around, when it comes to design, I'm going to give the edge to the Tab A8. And as far as portability, I'm gonna call it a tie. And another important difference is biometric authentication. So the iPad 9 uses Touch ID with the Home button while the Tab A8 uses face recognition with the front-facing camera. I'm not gonna say that one is definitively better than the other because it comes down to how you use your tablet. And ultimately, if I had my choice, I'd want both options like we have with the Tab S7. Now, probably one of the most important aspects of any tablet is the display. There are a few things that we wanna talk about, and let's also talk about how specs impact real-life use. With the Tab A8, we're getting a 10.5-inch display with a resolution of 1920 x 1200, a 16:10 aspect ratio, and a pixel density of 216 pixels per inch. The iPad 9 has a smaller display at 10.2 inches but a higher resolution of 2160 x 1620, an aspect ratio of 4:3, and a higher pixel density of 265 PPI. And the Tab A8 gives you a slightly wider display when you're watching content. And the aspect ratio is closer to the 16:9 that you get from a lot of videos, so there are smaller black bars on the top and the bottom. The iPad 9's higher resolution means that you can fit more information on the display at once. So for example, if you're looking at a webpage, you'll see more of the content without having to scroll. Additionally, the aspect ratio of 4:3 is very useful when you're taking notes or drawing with the Apple Pencil in Portrait Mode because we're getting a wider canvas. The iPad 9 also has a fingerprint-resistant coating, which makes a noticeable difference. It's not that it won't pick up fingerprints at all, but it definitely stays cleaner than the Tab A8. And I find myself not having to clean it as often with a microfiber cloth. Now, both are 60 hertz displays, but there are fundamental differences in the types of display that each tablet has. The iPad 9 does not have a fully laminated display, meaning that there is an air gap. On the Tab A8, the display, the touch layer, and the cover glass are fused into a single display assembly. For things like gaming, surfing the web, using various productivity apps, or watching video, you're unlikely to notice this difference. But in general, I prefer a fully laminated display because the image looks like it's painted right on top of the glass. A fully laminated display is typically also better when you're using a stylus because the tip of the pencil looks like it's touching the content that's being created. Whereas on the iPad 9, you will see a bit of separation. Now, in this particular case, while the iPad 9 is compatible with the 1st Generation Apple Pencil, the Tab A8 isn't compatible at all with Samsung's S Pen. So you can't use the Bluetooth-enabled S Pen that you get with a Tab S7 or S7 Plus or even the basic S Pen that you get with a Tab S7 FE. Now, both displays work just fine for everything that I do from watching content to playing games, surfing the web, and using various apps. If the larger black bars when watching video are an issue for you, then the Tab A8 is a better fit. Personally, they don't bother me at all. And for everyday use, I prefer the sharper and higher resolution display on the iPad 9, as well as the fingerprint-resistant coating, the 4:3 aspect ratio, and the Apple Pencil compatibility for note-taking, sketching, and for marking up and signing documents. If you're looking for more of a laptop-like experience, then you may wanna pick up a keyboard case. Now, the iPad 9 has a ton of excellent options from Apple and from third-party providers. I have not been able to find a dedicated keyboard case from Samsung for the Tab A8, but I did find this other option that has a removable keyboard. And I'll share a link in the description. It's actually kind of neat because you can use the same case with and without the keyboard. When we look at processing power, we've got benchmarks, and then we have real-life use. For single-core performance, the Tab A8 score 364 versus 1330 on the iPad 9. And for multi-core performance, we're looking at 1250 versus 3376. So we're getting substantially better performance on the iPad 9 for pretty much any type of task. But the real question is, does this have any kind of real-life implications for the majority of users? And in this case, the answer is a resounding yes. Like whether you're opening and closing apps, switching between opened apps or between opened tabs in your browser, or just navigating around the UI, the iPad 9 is extremely responsive. In comparison, the Tab A8 feels sluggish, laggy, and it feels underpowered for a current device. Now, that's not to say that you can't perform the same tasks, it's just that the user experience is not as smooth. And sometimes you're not sure if the Tab A8 is lagging or if a tap or a swipe wasn't registered. I'll get to how this impacts the gaming experience in just a moment. But first, let's talk about the camera and speakers. Now, this is another area where it's a split decision. Looking at the rear-facing cameras, both are eight megapixels, but the iPad 9 camera is simply better. It's more color accurate. It has better dynamic range. And it's more versatile in terms of features, frame rates, and image stabilization. I very rarely use the rear-facing cameras on my tablets because the ones on my phones are so much better. So for me, the more important camera on a tablet is the front-facing one, which I use for video calls. Again, the iPad 9 comes out ahead with a 12 megapixel camera versus 5 megapixels on the Tab A8. It's also an Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage, which is a feature that uses artificial intelligence to identify then track a subject as it moves through the frame. It can then crop the image to give the impression that the camera is following the subject. So in both cases, if you're looking for the better camera system, that's gonna be the iPad 9. When we get to the speakers, things shift in favor of the Tab A8. The iPad 9 only has speakers on the bottom. So when you're holding it in Landscape Mode, the audio only comes out to one side. It actually does a pretty good job at projecting the sound, but it can't compete with the Tab A8. The four-speaker Dolby Atmos system has better audio quality. It offers more immersive and fuller stereo sound. And it's better for games, where you need to detect which direction footsteps or other sounds come from. Before we get to battery life and gaming, let's talk about multitasking apps and operating system support. So for multitasking, I'm going to give the edge to the iPad 9. Both tablets have similar features, but again, the iPad 9 feels more responsive. And working with multiple apps feels seamless. The iPad 9 can also be used as an additional display for your Mac, your iMac, or your MacBook with a feature called Sidecar. Now, Samsung has a similar feature called Second Screen, but it's not available on the Tab A8. Now, looking at the app selections, both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store are full of choices for pretty much everything you wanna do. There are some specific popular creative apps like LumaFusion, Procreate and Affinity Photo that are only available on the iPad. LumaFusion did announce that they'll be releasing an Android version, so that's good news. As far as operating system support, Samsung promises three generations of OS updates. Now in contrast, Apple provides much longer support. And just as an example, my iPad Air 2, which I got eight years ago, is still supported by iPadOS 15. And moving on to battery life, both tablets have pretty good performance. And for the most part, I can get through an entire day with both. Of course, I can't sit down and play eight hours straight of \"PUBG\" without having to recharge either one of them. But for the most part, for what I do every day, I get through a full day. The iPad 9 probably does get the edge here, and I'm currently working on a more detailed test. When it comes to gaming, I'm able to play all of my games on both tablets. Less-demanding games are going to pretty much play on any current tablet, so that's not really an issue. But even more demanding games like \"PUBG\" and \"COD Mobile\" ran smoothly on both. For \"PUBG,\" on the Tab A8, I was able to set graphics to smooth or balanced, and then the frame rate to ultra. I could also set the graphics to HD, and then the frame rate to high. With the iPad 9, I could go all the way up to 90 frames per second with the graphic set to smooth. I could go up to extreme frame rate with balanced graphics or all the way up to ultra HD with frame rate set to ultra. Now, switching to \"COD Mobile,\" the Tab A8 tops out at medium graphic quality and high frame rate while the iPad 9 can go to very high graphic quality and max frame rate or very high graphic quality and very high frame rate. So in both games, the iPad 9 has the better options. Now, we talked a little bit about the audio early on in the video. But if you plan on using your speakers to play games where you need directional sound, the Tab A8 will perform better. Now, both tablets have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, which gives you the option of using a wired gaming headset for perfect lag-free audio. It also means that you can charge the tablet and use the wired headset at the same time without needing any type of adapter or a splitter. Both tablets also worked great with an Xbox controller and Xbox Game Pass. And I was able to play all of my favorite games as long as I had a fast and stable internet connection. I'm going to give the slight edge to the iPad 9 because in my opinion, it has a better display, and I had less issues with the controller disconnecting. Now, I wanna talk about the different configurations and also address resale value. I'll be using the prices from the Samsung and Apple Stores, but you can usually find better prices by using the links in the description. The Tab A8 is available with 32 gigabytes of storage and 3 gigs of RAM for 230 bucks, then 64 gigabytes for $280, and 128 gigabytes of storage for $330. And both of those models come with four gigabytes of RAM. The iPad 9 comes with either 64 gigabytes for 329 or 256 for 459. And both of them come with three gigabytes of RAM. So both tablets are also available on cellular models. And remember that the Tab A8 has a microSD card slot. It can be used to expand the internal storage and that this storage will be used for files and not for apps. Now, one thing to keep in mind, is that at least in the US, the iPads hold their resale value for longer. And at the same time, Samsung has some really great trade-in options. And I'd love to know what the situation is where you live. So which one of these tablets is a better option for you? So the Tab A8 starts at $230 for 32 gigabytes of internal storage. Although I would really only recommend that to someone who's just using it to stream content, to surf the web, work with some basic apps, and then play a few small games. If we're comparing the $330 models, then the Tab A8 comes with 120 gigs of internal storage, plus the microSD card slot, which can expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. It has a more modern design, facial recognition, a nice display, and a better speaker system. The iPad 9 comes with 64 gigabytes of internal storage. It can be upgraded to 256 for an additional $130, has a better display, Touch ID, Apple Pencil support, a better camera system. It's noticeably more powerful and more responsive, and it has better graphic performance for gaming. Now, you should see how the iPad 9 compares with the Galaxy Tab S7 FE.

The price is 19,990 baht for the Ram 8 GB model, 128 GB capacity, supports 5g, and the WiFi Only model is 8,990 baht. In addition, he also has Promotion with a 40% discount on Case W Cover for both the Galaxy Tab A9 and the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, all models, until December 31st. It's said to be organized for a long time.- Okay, so you're thinking of buying a Galaxy Tab S9 series tablet and you realize that there are three great options, but Samsung actually did something this year to make the decision even harder. So let's talk about all the important differences. This way you can have all the information that you need to choose the right Tab S9 series tablet for you. Starting out, we have the Tab S9 which got the most significant changes in this year's lineup. It retails for 799, and right now, using the links in the description, you can actually double the storage and get 50% more RAM for the same price, but we'll come back to that later. So over the past few years, Samsung didn't give the best displays to the smallest versions, like the Tab S7 and the Tab S8. It was still a very nice display, but it was an LCD display. Now, this year, the Tab S9 got the same upgrade as its two bigger siblings, and now it's sporting an amazing dynamic AMOLED 2X display. It's an 11-inch 120 hertz display with a resolution of 1,600 by 2,560, a 16 by 10 aspect ratio, and 274 pixels per inch. The display gives you the choice between a static 60 hertz or adaptive 120 hertz where the tablet changes in real time based on what you're doing. And this way you can save on battery life when you're looking at static content and you can get smooth and responsive animations when you're interacting with a UI, playing games, or doing anything else where a faster refresh rate offers the optimal user experience. This display has noticeably darker black levels than the previous models. It has better color accuracy, better contrast, and reduced blue light emission. The Tab S9 comes in graphite or beige. And looking around the edges, we see four speaker grills with four AKG-tuned speakers. In terms of audio quality, they're quite good for this size tablet and they work well for watching content and for games that don't require you to quickly identify where sounds are coming from. Obviously, for those types of games, you're better off using headsets, and there's a speaker test of all three tablets later on in this video when I talk about the Tab S9 Ultra. Now back to the Tab S9, we're getting a USB-C for charging and connecting accessories, and there's a micro SD cart slot which allows you to expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. Now, speaking of accessories, the Tab S9 comes with a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen. We're getting lower latency than last year's model, and it has bidirectional charging, so it doesn't matter which way you snap it to the back. Both the tablet and the S Pen have an IP68 rating, so you're getting protection from water and dust. And the Tab S9 is compatible with two keyboard cases from Samsung, the Book Cover Keyboard and the Book Cover Keyboard Slim. For biometric authentication, we got another upgrade from last year, and now we've got an outstanding under display fingerprint sensor to go along with facial recognition. This year, we also got a really impressive upgrade in performance with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, which has better single core performance in the last year's model and even greater improvement in multi-core and GPU performance. And the new Qualcomm chip also helps improve battery life. So on top of getting a larger battery this year at 8,400 milliampere-hour versus 8,000, we're also getting a more efficient chip. And I'm finishing up a detailed battery drain test of all three models. I'll also put the Tab S8 series test in the description if you want to check out those results. The Tab S9 gives us outstanding multitasking capabilities with three tiled apps at the same time, popup windows, and then of course DeX. If you're not familiar with it, DeX essentially reboots the tablet and gives you an operating system that's very similar to a desktop OS. You're getting a task bar, a desktop with icons, multiple windows. You can snap windows, and you can use a keyboard case to transform your tablet into more of a laptop replacement. You can also connect an external display keyboard and mouse and then run a super capable dual display setup. Now, one other great option is to use the Tab S9 as an additional display for your laptop or desktop with Samsung's Second Screen. This is a super handy feature when you travel. For cameras, we're getting a 13-megapixel front-facing camera and a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera. And for connectivity, we're getting Wi-Fi 6E compatibility just like with the two larger models. Looking at the configuration options, the 128-gigabyte model comes with eight gigs of RAM, and the 256-gigabyte model comes with 12 gigs of RAM. And remember that you can use the links in the description to get that upgrade for free, which is something that I would highly recommend doing. Ultimately, this is an extremely powerful and capable tablet at this price point. It's also a great option for someone who values portability, for users who prefer this size for gaming, or for users with smaller hands who find a smaller tablet easier to handle. Moving onto the Tab S9+, which starts out at $999. We're essentially getting the same design, but in a larger form factor. We're now getting the same type of display, dynamic AMOLED 2X, but it's larger at 12.4 inches. We're getting a higher resolution at 1,752 by 2,800, the same aspect ratio of 16 by 10, and a slightly lower pixel density, but not something that's really noticeable in terms of sharpness. Now, watching content on this display is fantastic. The image quality is outstanding. And since the aspect ratio is so close to the image that's being displayed, they're very small black bars at the top and the bottom. Also, if you fill to zoom, you're getting a very minor crop and then the image covers the entire display and looks great. Again, we're getting four AKG-tuned speakers, but these are warmer and fuller than the ones on the Tab S9. We're getting the same USB-C 3.2 ports, same Bluetooth 5.3, and Wi-Fi 6E compatibility, but a larger battery than the Tab S9 at 10,090 milliampere-hour. And like all three tablets, we're getting fast wire charging at 45 watts. Now, keep in mind that none of these tablets come with a charger, and I'll put some links in the description to a few of my favorites. We have the same options for biometric authentication with an under-display fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. We're getting the same S Pen with the same low latency, and the same IP68 protection for the S Pen and the tablet. Now, even though we have the same multitasking features, the larger display on the Tab S9+ gives the edge over the smaller Tab S9, and that's true for multiple tiled apps, for DeX, and when we're using it as an external display. When it comes to gaming, this model might be the sweet spot in terms of size. You're getting a larger display, but it's not too big, so it's great for handheld games and when you wanna connect to controller, and then stream some games using the Xbox Game Pass app. It has the same 13-megapixel front-facing camera as the Tab S9. But in addition to the 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, it also has an eight-megapixel ultra wide. We're getting the same powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, but the Tab S9+ starts with 256 gigabytes and 12 gigs if RAM. And again, right now you can double the storage and get the 512 gigabyte model for the same price. The Tab S9+ is right there in the middle. It's giving you a noticeably larger display, a slightly better camera module, better speakers, a larger battery, and more storage. All right, so now we move on to the Tab S9 Ultra, which starts out at $1,199. It's the biggest tablet that Samsung makes, and it's what some people would say is inarguably the best display on any tablet. Now, whether you agree or not, if you've had a chance to use this tablet in real life, you have to admit that this display is spectacular. It's massive at 14.6 inches, still dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120 hertz. It has the highest resolution at 1,848 by 2,960 the same 16 by 10 aspect ratio, and a pixel density of 239. Now, surprisingly, the Tab S9 Ultra is the thinnest of all three tablets. It's not by a lot, but when you couple the larger size with the thinnest tablet, the user experience is that of using some sort of a futuristic display. I'll admit that it's probably not for everyone. It's definitely the least portable option, although, honestly, for me, I always carry it in my backpack. So it doesn't really impact me in that context, but there is one specific area where it's actually too big, and I'll get to that in just a minute. And we're getting all the same biometric features the same connectivity, same IP68 rating, but we do see another change when it comes to the camera module. So we have the 13-megapixel wide and the eight-megapixel ultra wide that we saw on the Tab S9+ on the back of the tablet. But on the front we're now getting two 13-megapixel cameras with a wide and an ultra wide. We're also getting a small notch which is something that I feel like I have to address. So I've heard both sides of the argument and my perspective in short is that it just doesn't matter. The display is so big and the notch is like this big. It's so tiny that I never really notice it. Now, of course, if it's something that you're gonna be fixated on, then it's not really the tablet for you and you should probably go with something like the Tab S9+. But it's just never really been an issue or in the way for any of the ways that I use this tablet. The Tab S9 Ultra is right now my favorite tablet to watch content on. The fact that I can get an image to be this big, this close to me is super impressive. We're also getting the best audio quality using the built-in speakers. And here's a quick sample from all three tablets. (\"On & On\") ♪ Hold me close 'til I get up ♪ ♪ Time is barely on our side ♪ ♪ I don't wanna waste what's left ♪ ♪ The storms we chase are leading us ♪ ♪ And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah ♪ ♪ No, I don't wanna waste what's left ♪ ♪ And on and on we'll go ♪ ♪ Through the wastelands, through the highways ♪ ♪ 'Til my shadow turns to sun rays ♪ ♪ And on and on we'll go ♪ ♪ Through the wastelands, through the highways ♪ ♪ And on and on we'll go ♪ - We're getting the largest battery of all three at 11,200 milliampere-hours, but of course it has to power the largest display, so I'm super excited to show you my battery test, and make sure that you're subscribed so you don't miss out. For multitasking DeX and second screen, this is the best option because it's such a useful size and you can have so much content on it and you can really improve your productivity. Now, the one area where this tablet was too big for me was when I'm playing \"PUBG\" and holding it in the air. It just feels cumbersome and my hands get pretty tired after a couple games. Now, if you play with a tablet flat on the desk or on a pillow, then that's another completely different story. And in that case, I love having the larger display because it's easier to see smaller movements. It's definitely the best tablet to use with a controller because it's like having a super light and portable TV with you anywhere you go. For configuration options, it starts out with 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 12 gigs of RAM. And again, you can double the storage right now for the same price. And if you go to one terabyte, you also get bumped up to 16 gigabytes of RAM. If you want the biggest tablet with the biggest display for watching content, if you multitask, use your tablet as a laptop replacement with DeX, or use it for second screen, and if you want the largest gaming display Samsung offers in a tablet, get yourself a Tab S9 Ultra. It's probably my favorite tablet in the lineup. And this display just puts a smile on my face every time I use it. And whenever a new person sees me using it for the first time, it's super obvious that there is something very special about this tablet. Now you should check out this comparison. Hopefully this video is helpful. Click on my face to subscribe. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.- A few days ago, I compared the Tab S9+ to the 11 inch iPad Pro, but I got a few comments saying that a better comparison would be with a 12.9 inch model because for one, they're closer in size. And while that's true there are some things that are a little confusing and thank you to Best buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. So back to this size, when you have these tablets side by side in portrait mode you can see that they're pretty much the same height but the iPad is noticeably wider. It's also a little bit thicker and heavier, but not really something that would make a meaningful difference in terms of portability. These are both premium flagship tablets. So as you would expect, the build quality is excellent and I haven't had any type of issues with bending. I do like the fact that both the Tab S9+ and the S Pen, which we'll talk about in just a minute, both have an IP68 rating. So I know I'm getting protection from water and dust. Looking at the overall design, there's lots of similarities. So we're getting rounded corners, squared off edges and there are four speakers so we're getting very good sound at least for tablets. Now, typically I find it pretty easy to pick a winner but this was a really close call. So here's a sound test and let me know which one you think sounds better. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) Now continuing around the edges, both tablets have USB-C ports for charging and connecting accessories. The one on the Tab S9+ is 3.2, and the one on the iPad Pro is a more powerful Thunderbolt four port which has faster transfer speeds. This isn't going to matter to the majority of users but if you're a creator or if you're a photographer or if you're anyone who regularly transfers a lot of files to and from the tablet, you'll definitely appreciate having the faster transfer speeds on the iPad Pro. Now, an advantage of the Tab S9+ is that it has a micro SD card slot, so I can relatively inexpensively expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. It also means that I have the flexibility of not getting all the storage I need right away if I can't afford it. I can just buy the tablet now and then add storage when my budget allows for it. And I can use the micro SD storage for files, for photos, for videos, and for most apps. We see some more separation when we look at biometric authentication where the iPad uses Face ID and the Tab S9 plus offers a great under display fingerprint sensor and then a less secure face recognition option. All three choices work well for me so it's really gonna come down to whether you want the more secure facial biometric with the iPad or the versatility of multiple options with a Tab S9+. Now let's get to one of the most important features in a tablet. The display. So the Tab S9+ has a 12.4 inch dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a resolution of 1752 by 2,800, a 16:10 aspect ratio, 120 Hertz adaptive refresh rate and 266 pixels per inch. The iPad Pro has a larger 12.9 inch liquid retina XDR display with a high resolution of 2048 by 2732, an aspect ratio of 4:3, 120 Hertz adaptive refresh rate and a pixel density of 265 pixels per inch. So both displays are great. Let's just get that out of the way. You're not gonna get either one of these and think that they're terrible displays like these are the best displays that Apple and Samsung have to offer in a tablet. And of course, if you wanna see this iPad compared with a larger Tab S9 Ultra I'll link to that video at the end of this one. Now, the way I would choose between these two is based on what you plan on doing. If you're watching content you're getting essentially the same size image with both devices with just larger black bars on the iPad Pro. And that's not really something that bothers me because I'm not looking at the part of the screen that's black. Another thing to think about is that the iPad Pro is brighter for both SDR and HDR content which doesn't really matter if you're indoors, but if you have to deal with reflections or if you work outside it's always nice to have that additional brightness. Now, when you hold each tablet in portrait mode you'll be able to see more content on the iPad without having to scroll. And actually the same is true even in landscape mode. In terms of image quality, both are exceptional like really what both companies did here is very impressive. And the one advantage that I'm gonna give Samsung is that you can get this same type of display on the smaller Tab S9 or the larger Tab S9 Ultra. And with Apple, you can only get this display on the 12.9 inch model. But again, back to these two specific displays you really can't go wrong.

Now when we talk about this level of tablets another important consideration is the ability to expand functionality by adding a keyboard case and a stylus. There's some really interesting implications here. Starting with keyboard options the iPad Pro is compatible with Apple's larger magic keyboard and also some excellent third party options. The Tab S9+ is compatible with two different versions of the book covered keyboard from Samsung, but keep in mind that you can't use the keyboards from the Tab S7+ or the Tab S8+ because the camera modules are different and they won't fit. And then finally of course, you can use an external Bluetooth keyboard with both tablets. Now, personally, I prefer the feel of the keys on the magic keyboard and the track pad is definitely better. It also has a USB-C pass through so you can charge the iPad while still being able to connect accessories. The Tab S9+ keyboards do a much better job at securing the S Pen so it doesn't fall off when it's in my bag and there's a full row of function keys. Now moving on to the stylus options. The iPad Pro is compatible with the second generation Apple Pencil. It pairs wirelessly. It can be stored and charged on the side of the iPad and it costs 130 bucks. The Tab S9+ comes with a free S Pen, which also pairs wirelessly. It can be stored on the side or the back of the Tab S9+, but it will only charge on the back. Now you're able to assign functions to the button on the S Pen which is similar to Apple's double tap functionality but the S Pen also has several Bluetooth functions so you can use it to take pictures, control media playback and for several other useful tasks. Now, the S Pen doesn't need to be charged in order to write or draw. It's only for the Bluetooth functions whereas the Apple Pencil does need to be charged in order to function at all. Now, realistically, this isn't a very meaningful difference to me because my Apple Pencil is always charging while it's being stored and the battery lasts forever but it's still something that I wanted to mention. Now both stylus options offer very low latency, but the feeling of writing or drawing is actually quite different. The Apple Pencil has a firm tip so it's a little harsher when it hits the glass and it feels like you're writing or drawing on a single sheet of paper that's placed on a hard surface. The S Pen has a softer tip so when it hits the glass, it gives a little. It feels more like you're writing on a full pad of paper where the pages compress as you press down. Now, one isn't objectively better than the other for every use case, and it's really going to come down to which one feels better for you. So hopefully this description was helpful. Another area where we see some important differences is when we look at apps and long-term support. I'm not going to get into iPad OS versus Android. Both operating systems are very powerful and they have their strengths and weaknesses and that really belongs in a separate video. There are lots of apps in the Galaxy Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, so the majority of users are easily going to find what they need. Now, some creative specific apps like Affinity Photo and Procreate are only available for the iPad. So if those are absolutely necessary for your workflow, then go ahead and get the iPad. If you don't need them, then that's not really a deciding factor for you. LumaFusion, which has historically been an iPad only app is now available for Android, which is is great news but another advantage for the iPad is that now you can use Final Cut Pro. Now for taking notes, Notability is only available for iPad but Good Notes has an Android version, and Samsung Notes is actually an outstanding option and it comes included with the Tab S9+. Now overall, I have to give the edge to the iPad Pro because almost every app is optimized for a tablet and with the Tab S9+, a lot of the apps are just stretched out versions of the phone apps. As far as operating system support, Apple has always provided excellent long-term support. And while Samsung now offers four years of OS updates and five years of security updates, Apple still has the advantage here if that's a priority for you. Looking at the camera systems, both tablets have an ultra wide 12 megapixel front facing camera. The iPad Pro record it up to 1080p60. The Tab S9+ can go up to 4K30. And here's a quick sample. Here's a camera on microphone test of the Tab S9+ and the 12.9 inch M2 iPad Pro. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect. Now for video calls, I prefer the placement of the camera on the Tab S9+ because it's in the center of the long edge. So I'm always properly framed and it appears as if I'm looking at the person that I'm talking to. On the iPad Pro because the camera is on the short side when I'm watching the screen, the camera is off to my left and then it looks like I'm looking away from the person that I'm talking to. Now moving onto the rear facing camera modules, the Tab S9+ has a 13 megapixel wide and an eight megapixel ultra-wide camera versus a 12 megapixel wide and a 10 megapixel ultra-wide on the iPad Pro. Both tablets have a flash but the iPad Pro also includes a LIDAR scanner which is great for auto focus and low light and for augmented reality apps. Now both tablets also have some excellent multitasking capabilities. With the iPad Pro you can have two apps open side by side, in split view you can have slide over windows and you can have a popup window in the center. The Tab S9+ allows you to have three tiled apps open at the same time. You can resize each window to get the configuration that works best for you and you can still have pop-up windows. Now, both tablets can also be used as a second display for your laptop or desktop. Apple calls this feature sidecar and Samsung calls it second screen. Now, an important advantage of the Tab S9+ and for that matter, the Tab S9 and the Tab S9 Ultra is that you can reboot it in DeX mode which basically gives you a desktop like user interface with a task bar, desktop icons, and floating windows. You can even pair a keyboard, a mouse and an external monitor for an extremely powerful dual display setup. Now, Apple did release stage manager for the iPad Pro, which is an improvement. It means that you can finally connect to an external display without black bars on the left and the right. You can also extend your DeX app to the external display and move apps and windows to it for a true dual display setup. It's great to see that Apple continues to improve the capabilities of the iPad and I love how fluid and seamless multitasking is. I also like the larger display, and with the Tab S9+, you can have more tiled apps open at the same time and it has DeX. So I would consider it the more capable multitasking option but it would ultimately come down to what you prioritize and which ecosystem you're in. Now, as far as configuration options the iPad Pro comes with the M2 chip which is the most powerful chip in any tablet. Every model up to 512 gigabytes of storage comes with eight gigs of RAM. And the one and two terabyte models come with 16 gigs of RAM. The Tab S9+ comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, and both the 256 and the 512 gigabyte models come with 12 gigs of RAM. So let's quickly look at benchmarks for those of you who are interested. And it's no surprise that the iPad Pro comes out ahead for single core performance and that the gap increases even more for multi-core performance and GPU performance. Now, not everyone is editing 8K video on their tablets so sheer processing power may not be the most important factor for you, but all things being equal having additional headroom in terms of performance just means that the device will continue to work great for your needs as time goes on. And one thing is for sure the Samsung upgrade to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip improves battery life on this year's Samsung tablets. How much screen on time you actually get from your tablet really depends on what you do. For me, the Tab S9+ has lasted a few hours longer during a typical day of use. And when connected to a high capacity charger the iPad charge in approximately two hours which is about 10 minutes faster than the Tab S9+. Now, I do a lot of gaming on my tablets and I've had a ton of fun playing games on both of these. Now obviously, both chips are extremely capable so basic games aren't gonna be a challenge. But even more demanding games like PUBG, COD Mobile and Genshin Impact run very smoothly on both devices. Playing PUBG, I could go up to 90 frames per second on both tablets with graphics set to smooth or all the way up to ultra HD for graphics and ultra for frame rate. In terms of gaming performance, I'm going to give the edge to the iPad Pro because it has additional headroom in terms of performance and it will continue to perform better for longer as games become more and more demanding. And in terms of handling, they're close enough in terms of width to where handling feels pretty much the same and the Tab S9+ is a little bit lighter, but it's really not a huge difference. When I want to play cloud-based games then I just pair my Xbox controller and then I can play any game that's available with the Xbox Game Pass app. In that context, I'm primarily using the tablet as a display, so I prefer the larger iPad Pro. Now, when we look at pricing we see some extremely important differences. Now, I'm going to use the prices off of the Apple and Samsung stores because they're standardized but you can usually find better prices by using the links in the description. So the iPad Pro starts out at $1,199 and the Tab S9+ starts out at $999. But keep in mind that the iPad Pro starts out with 128 gigabytes of storage versus 256 gigabytes on the Tab S9+. And right now, using the links in the description you can actually get 512 gigabytes on the Tab S9+ for the same price and that's gonna cost you $1,399 on the iPad. If you need a lot of internal storage the iPad Pro goes all the way up to two terabytes. The Tab S9+ maxes out at 512 gigabytes. But again, you can use the micro SD card slot for additional storage. Also, remember that if you want a stylus the S Pen is included with the price of the Tab S9+, and the second generation Apple Pencil will cost you an additional 130 bucks. Now, you should check out this comparison. Click on my face to subscribe. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.- If you look closely, you'll notice that even though the Tab S9+ and the Tab S9 FE+ look very similar, there are some incredibly meaningful differences for both average and power users. Neither of these tablets have the most powerful chip Samsung has put in a mobile device. That honor is currently reserved for the S24 Ultra and the rest of the S24 lineup, with the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 chip. And at the same time, processing power is one meaningful differentiator between these two tablets, along with the display, the speakers, the camera, multitasking, and the stylus. Keep in mind that we have to take price into account because we're looking at $999 for the base Tab S9+ versus 549 for the FE+. And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. Now I mentioned multitasking, which might be a little confusing because both tablets run the latest Android and One UI, and that means that you are technically getting all of the latest features, like three-tiled apps, pop-up windows, and then of course, DeX, which is awesome. Essentially, DeX reboots the tablet and gives it an operating system that's very similar to a desktop OS. You're getting a task bar, a desktop with icons, multiple windows, you can snap windows, and you can use a keyboard case to transform your tablet into more of a laptop replacement. But there is one important DeX feature that's only available on the Tab S9+, and that's the ability to connect an external display and run a super capable dual display setup. The FE+ version does not have this feature. You can, however, use either tablet as an additional display for your Windows laptop or desktop with Samsung's Second Screen, and I use this feature both in the office and when I travel. Now looking at the displays, both are 12.4 inches, and have the same aspect ratio of 16 by 10, which makes them great for watching content. But in terms of the actual specs, that's pretty much where the similarities end. The Tab S9+ has a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, which offers 120 hertz adaptive refresh rate, a resolution of 1752 by 2800, and a pixel density of 266 pixels per inch. The Tab S9 FE+ has an IPS LCD display, which offers a slower 90 hertz adaptive refresh rate, a lower resolution of 1600 by 2560, and a lower pixel density of 243 pixels per inch. In terms of image quality, the FE+ display is very good. And for the price, we're getting terrific image quality for watching video and for playing games. And while we're not getting 120 hertz and the animations and scrolling are not as smooth as they are in the Tab S9+, we are getting 90 hertz, which is a step up from the previous FE model. Now having said that, there's no question that the Dynamic AMOLED 2X display on the flagship model is the superior display. Colors seem to pop off the screen, we're getting outstanding blacks, better contrast, and again, the UI animations and scrolling looks smoother. Overall, I have to give the edge to the Tab S9+, but I don't think that I would pay twice as much just for the display. As far as the overall design, the two tablets are very similar with a full aluminum frame in back. They have the same footprint, but the Tab S9+ is a bit thinner and lighter. I appreciate that Samsung was able to bring the IP68 rating down to the FE+ version, giving both tablets protection from water and dust. This is really valuable if you take your tablet with you when you travel or if you take it to work, but it's also a great feature when you're just around the house and you have a dog that likes to clear everything off the table with her tail. Both tablets offer face recognition for biometric authentication and a more secure fingerprint sensor. With the Tab S9+, we're getting an under-display sensor, and with the FE+, it's integrated into the power button. Now, both sensors have worked great for me and they're super responsive and accurate, but I prefer the under-display version on the Tab S9+ because it's more organic to how I hold the tablet. Now, both tablets also have a MicroSD card slot, so you can upgrade the internal storage by up to one terabyte, and you can use that storage for photos, for videos, files, and for most apps. Now, continuing to look around the edges, we're getting four AKG tuned speaker on the Tab S9+ versus two on the FE+. And the flagship model definitely has a more full sound. The audio seems warmer and has more presence to it, which makes it a better choice for watching content. Now, both tablets have a USB-C port for charging and connecting accessories, but we're looking at 3.2 on the Tab S9+ versus only 2.0 on the FE+. Now, depending on what type of games you play, you may or may not notice a difference. If you're just playing less demanding games, you can easily do that on both tablets, but as you start playing more resource-intensive games, like \"Genshin Impact,\" \"COD Mobile,\" and \"PUBG,\" there's a noticeable difference in both processing power and GPU performance, which does have an impact on my gaming experience. I'll quickly cover benchmarks and the Performance section, but there's no question that Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 gen 2 chip in the Tab S9+ is more capable than the Exynos 1380 in the FE+ version. Starting with \"Genshin Impact,\" I was able to play it on both devices, but the game performed better on the Tab S9+, with smoother graphics and less lag because of the more capable processor and the additional RAM. When playing \"PUBG,\" gameplay was smoother and more responsive on the Tab S9+. And I could play with Graphics set to Smooth and Frame Rate set to 90 FPS. I could also set graphics anywhere from Balanced to HDR and Frame Rate set to Extreme, or Ultra HD for Graphics and Ultra for Frame Rate. With the FE+ model, I was limited to High Frame Rate, whether graphics were set to Smooth, Balanced, or HD. And then, of course, since that was as good as it got, I could get nowhere near 90 FPS. If playing more demanding games is a priority for you, then we know that game developers are always going to push the CPU and GPU and games are going to continue to evolve and demand more and more resources. When I look to keep a device for at least four to five years or even more, I'm always going to opt for the tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance than what I need now so that it continues to perform well in the future. Now, if you want to stream and play Xbox Games with the Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox controller with both tablets and have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection.

Now back to the tablets, another important factor for some users is the ability to expand the functionality of each tablet by adding a keyboard case and a stylus. Now, both tablets are compatible with the same two versions of the Book Cover Keyboard from Samsung. And of course, you can always use an external keyboard and mouse. Now, both tablets also come with a free S Pen, which can be stored on the side or on the back of the tablet, but only the Tab S9+ has a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen, which offers some wireless functionality for things like camera and media playback. Now in terms of the actual writing or drawing experience, for most users, it's virtually identical, and neither requires a charge in order to write or draw. Looking at the camera systems, the Tab S9+ has a 13 megapixel wide and an eight megapixel ultrawide versus two eight megapixel cameras on the Tab S9 FE+. Both tablets have a 12 megapixel selfie camera, and here's a short sample. Here's a camera and microphone test of the Tab S9+. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get. And the Tab S9+ looks a little overexposed me. All I did was press Record. I didn't change any of the settings. We quickly talked about performance in the Gaming section. So let's look at the single and multi-core performance of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and the Exynos 1380, where we see the Snapdragon chip pull way ahead. We also see a score considerably higher in GPU performance, which helps explain some of the meaningful differences we saw when gaming. But I know that not everyone games, and these are just benchmarks. So what about typical average real life use? Well, of course you can surf the web, watch videos, or go on social media with both tablets, but essentially, in every aspect, the Tab S9+ feels snappier and more responsive. Even just navigating around the UI, opening and closing apps, you can notice a difference. And I would expect it to continue to perform better for longer. Now, power users who perform more demanding tasks, like photo and video editing, should definitely opt for the more capable Tab S9+. But always keep in mind what you plan on doing so that you don't overpay for performance that you don't need. Now, as far as OS and security updates, Samsung promises four years of OS updates and five years of security updates, which is nice. And again, keep in mind the difference in performance if you plan on keeping your tablet for a while. In terms of battery life, both tablets have a 10,090 milliampere-hour battery, but Samsung rates the FE+ model at 20 hours versus 16 hours on the Tab S9+. Now that I have the entire Tab S9 and FE lineup, I'm finishing the edit of my battery test. So go ahead and subscribe to be notified when it's published. Now, both Tablets offer 45 watts Super Fast Charging, which gets you to 100% in about 90 minutes, but neither tablet ships with a charging adapter, so that's something that you'll need to get separately. Now, when we look at the configuration options, the Tab S9+ is available with 256 or 512 gigabytes of internal storage, and both models come with 12 gigabytes of RAM. The FE+ model comes with 120 gigabytes of storage and eight gigs of RAM, or 256 and 12. Now, of course, more RAM is always better, but your typical FE+ user isn't a power user, so I would only upgrade the RAM if you also need the additional internal storage. Now, overall, it's clear that the Tab S9+ is the more powerful and capable tablet, has a better display, a much more powerful chip with better CPU and GPU performance, more internal storage, better speakers, a better camera system, external display support, and a better S Pen. But at about half the price, the Tab S9 FE+ is a very good value. If you don't need the best performance or the absolute best quality display, you're still getting the same size display, IP68 protection, and a lot of the same features, with better battery life. Now, you should check out this comparison. Hopefully this video is helpful. Click on my face to subscribe. You know what I always say, \"Buy it nice or buy it twice.\" Good luck and see you soon.- When Samsung released the FE version of the Tab S9, I was so excited and I couldn't wait to do this comparison with the iPad 10. Both tablets are about the same size and the same price, but the choice wasn't as easy as I initially thought it would be. And by the way, I know prices around the world are very different, so if you're watching this from outside of the US, please let me know in the comment section where you're from and how much each of these tablets cost because obviously this is a really important factor and thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. So the first thing most people consider is the display. And in this case, the iPad 10 has a 10.9 inch liquid retina 60 Hertz display with the resolution of 1640 by 2360, a four by three aspect ratio and 264 pixels per inch. The Tab S9 FE also has a 10.9 inch IPS LCD display, but it's a 90 Hertz display, has a resolution of 1440 by 2304, an aspect ratio of 16 by 10 and then a lower pixel density of 249. Now in terms of image quality, both displays are sharp and crisp, and if I'm being critical, the iPad has better color accuracy and the Tab S9 FE is a bit warmer and has a slight greenish shift. I do like that it's a 90 Hertz display on the Tab S9 FE because things like animations and scrolling look smoother. Now, 60 Hertz has never really been a deal breaker for me. Right now I'm using three different phones, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Samsung S23 Ultra and the Pixel 8 Pro. So I'm used to 120 Hertz, but I think a higher refresh rate is a nice to have, but not critical for most tasks on mobile devices. There are exceptions, of course, like some games, but things got a little strange there. So I'll come back to that in the dedicated gaming section of this video. Now, in terms of aspect ratio, the Tab S9 FE is better suited for watching video because the 16 by 10 aspect ratio is closer to most content and the image is larger and has smaller black bars. Now with the iPad 10, we're getting a four by three aspect ratio, which is wider in portrait mode, and it's really nice when taking handwritten notes using the Apple Pencil. Now another important difference is that the Tab S9 FE has a fully laminated display. So the display, the touch layer and the cover glass are fused together into a single display assembly and the image looks like it's printed right on top of the glass. On the iPad 10, there is an air gap between the display and the combination of cover glass and touch layer. For a lot of things like watching movies, surfing the web or playing games, it's not really something that you're going to notice unless you really look for it, but when you're using the stylus, it does make a difference. So with the iPad 10, you'll be able to see separation between the tip of the Apple Pencil and the content that's being created, especially if you're looking at an angle. With the Tab S9 FE because the image looks like it's on top of the glass, it's going to look like the tip of the S Pen is touching the line or the content that you're creating, which of course is better. The one advantage of a non laminated display is that if the display gets damaged, most of the time it's just a cover glass so replacement is relatively inexpensive. With a fully laminated display, the entire display assembly has to be replaced even if you just scratch the cover glass. I'll also get to a few other important stylus differences in just a moment, but first I want to talk about gaming. So I play a lot of games on my tablets and I was really curious to see how these two would match up. So I was able to play my usual games like Genshin, Asphalt and PUBG and then of course less demanding games. But there was an obvious difference in both processing power and GPU performance, which did have an impact on more resource intensive games. I'll quickly show you benchmarks in the performance section, but this was one of those areas where I could clearly see the advantage of the iPad's A14 chip over the Exynos 1380. Now using PUBG as an example, gameplay was smoother and more responsive on the iPad, and I could play with balanced graphics and extreme frame rate versus balanced graphics and high frame rate on the Tab S9. And then of course, I could definitely not get to the 90 FPS that would take advantage of the faster refresh rate on the Samsung display. I had a similar experience with Genshin, which again performed better on the iPad 10, even though it has less RAM than a Tab S9 FE. Now looking ahead, we know that game developers are always looking to push the CPU and GPU and games are going to evolve and start to demand more and more resources. If I'm looking for a device to keep for the next four or five years or even more, I'm always going to opt for the tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance than what I need right now so it continues to perform well into the future. Now, if you wanna stream and play Xbox Games with the Xbox Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox controller with both tablets and have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection. But there's one area where the Tab S9 FE comes out ahead and that's storage. The iPad 10 starts out with 64 gigabytes of internal storage versus 128 gigs on the Tab S9 FE. To give you a sense of what that means, iPad OS currently takes up a little over 10 gigabytes of storage, system data takes up another 11 gigs, and PUBG uses a little over 20 gigs. So that's 41 out of 64 available gigabytes already used up with no other apps, files or photos. Now both tablets are also available in 256 gigabyte options. With the iPad, that's an additional 150 bucks, and with the Tab S9 FE, it's an extra 70 bucks. Now the Tab S9 FE also has a micro SD card slot, which you can use to expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. And you can use this storage for files, photos, videos, and for most apps. We'll talk more about the configuration options later on but for right now, I just wanna make sure that you have enough storage for all the apps and the games that you want to install. And that brings me to today's sponsor Best Buy and the Western Digital Storage Solutions for gamers. If you have a PlayStation 5, the Western Digital Black SN850 P NVME SSD is officially licensed. It's extremely easy to install. It's unbelievably fast, and this one terabyte version means that I'm not wasting any time deleting and downloading games when I run out of space.

So do it right and visit bestbuy.com to get a super fast Western Digital drive that was specifically designed for your gaming needs. And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this portion of the video. When we look at the overall design of these tablets, they're quite similar since Apple upgraded from the older iPad 9 design. Both tablets are machined aluminum, both have rounded corners and squared off edges, but the Tab S9 FE has slightly smaller bezels. We're getting a fingerprint sensor incorporated into the power button in both devices, on the iPad 10 it's on the short side, on the Tab S9 FE it's on the longer side, and both have been very accurate and responsive for me, but the iPad 10 has four speaker grills versus two on the Tab S9 FE, but both tablets only have two speakers, one on each side. In terms of audio quality, both are good but not as good as the higher end models. And the Tab S9 FE speakers are a tad louder and sound a bit brighter. One thing that I found when I'm gaming and holding the tablet in my hand is that on the iPad Air 4, I'm actually covering the speakers with my hand. So there are two other grills, so the sound can't come from there. But on the Tab S9 FE, the speakers are on the top if I'm holding in a landscape mode, so I'm not blocking them. Now personally, I'm okay either way because whenever I'm gaming, I'm wearing a headset, but I just wanted to mention it in case you don't. The Tab S9 FE also has an IP 68 rating, so we're getting protection from water and dust. Now, obviously this is important if you take your tablet with you and you travel or when you go outside, but even when you're just around the house, it's nice to have additional protection from accidental spills. Now, both tablets use a USB-C port for charging and connecting accessories, which brings me to the stylus and keyboard options. The iPad 10 is compatible with the first generation Apple Pencil, which costs $99. It pairs and charges using a cable, and it requires a USB to lightning adapter. The iPad is also compatible with the newer USB-C Apple Pencil, which charges and pairs with a wire but doesn't require an adapter. It costs $79. It doesn't offer pressure sensitivity, but it does magnetically attach to the side of the iPad. The Tab S9 FE comes with a free S Pen, which can be stored on the side or on the back of the tablet. It has a programmable button and it doesn't need to be charged in order to write or draw. Now, in terms of the actual writing experience, the Apple Pencil has a firm tip, so it's a little harsher when it hits the glass and it feels like you're writing on a single sheet of paper that's placed on a hard surface. The S Pen has a softer tip to it, so when it hits the glass, it gives a little, and it feels more like you're writing on a full pad of paper where the pages compress as you press down. Now, one isn't objectively better than the other for every single use and it's going to come down to which one feels better for you. So as always, I hope this description helps you make a choice. Now, as far as the camera systems, the iPad has a more capable rear facing camera in terms of resolution and frame rate, and both tablets have a 12 megapixel front facing camera. And here's a quick sample. Here's a camera and microphone test of the iPad 10 and the Tab S9 FE. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect from each tablet. Now, both tablets also have the front facing camera on the long edge, so you're always properly framed during video calls. Now, when we talked about gaming, I mentioned the performance of the iPad's A14 Bionic, and the Tab S9 FE's Exynos 1380. So let's quickly look at single and multi-core performance where we see the Apple chip pull ahead. We also see it's scored noticeably higher in GPU performance, which helps explain some of the differences we saw. Now, of course, these are just benchmark scores. So what about just typical real life use? Well, if you're surfing the web, watching video or going on social media, it doesn't really matter that much. You can easily do that with both tablets, but the iPad does feel snappier and more responsive, and I would expect it to continue to perform better for longer. Now, if you're doing something like a very heavy video editing, then again the iPad would be a better choice. When multitasking, the iPad can run two apps in split view, plus additional apps in a slide over window. The Tab S9 FE can run three tiled apps at the same time with more flexibility when it comes to how much real estate each app takes. It can also run multiple floating windows, which can be resized, and you can even change the transparency. Now, both tablets have a customizable dock, but the Tab S9 FE also has a super handy side panel for quick access. Now, both tablets can be used as additional displays for compatible desktops and laptops. Apple calls this feature sidecar and Samsung calls it second screen. These are great features and you should all use them, but if you're looking for more of a laptop replacement, the Tab S9 FE has DeX, which I love, but there is one limitation here. So if you're new to Samsung, DeX essentially reboots the tablet with an OS that looks very similar to what you get on a laptop. You've got a task bar where you can minimize and see active apps. You have an actual desktop with icons, and you can run multiple floating windows or snap windows to the side of the display. But unlike with the higher end Tab S9, S9+ and S9 Ultra, you can't connect an external monitor and run a dual display setup. The iPad 10 does let you mirror your display to an external display, but it doesn't stretch out to fill the entire monitor because the iPad 10 doesn't fully support stage manager, and it's not an extended display. So when it comes to being a laptop replacement, it's still a win for the Tab S9 FE, but not quite as good as what you get with the higher end models. Now, battery life is always interesting because it comes down to what you actually do. So comparing these devices when they're new, I'm looking at about 10 hours on the iPad 10, about 13 to 14 hours on a Tab S9 FE. Again, depending on what I was doing. Now, of course, these times are not of me gaming the entire time, and they include things like surfing the web, watching video, using social media apps, and working with productivity apps. Now, when you're looking at available apps, the Google Play Store, the Galaxy Store and the Apple App Store have a ton of options for pretty much everything that you need. In general, I'm going to give the edge to the iPad 10 because the apps seem to be better optimized for a tablet. But as I've said in recent videos, the gap continues to shrink. Several creative apps like Affinity Photo and Procreate are only available for the iPad, but it's great to see that there's an Android version of Luma Fusion. Now, both tablets run the latest available operating systems and Samsung promises four years of OS upgrades and five years of security updates. Now, Apple devices typically get longer support than that. So when I take into account the improved CPU and GPU performance, I'm going to give the iPad the edge in terms of longevity. I also want you to consider other products that you own which make up your ecosystem. Now, Samsung has made some really impressive improvements over the past few years, adding much needed integration between multiple devices, wireless file and text sharing, then additional cross device integrations. And even though the gap again continues to shrink, Apple's ecosystem is still more complete and more tightly integrated due to the fact that they have full control over the hardware and software on all of their devices. Now, when we look at configuration options and prices from the official stores, we already talked about the storage options, but both the 64 and 256 gigabyte models of the iPad 10 come with four gigabytes of RAM. with the Tab S9 FE, the 128 gigabyte model comes with six gigs of RAM and the 256 gigabyte model comes with eight. So here's how I look at this choice. The iPad is more powerful and will be more capable if you plan on keeping your device for many years and you like to play more demanding games at higher settings or performing other resource intensive tasks. It also offers better optimized apps, access to some creative specific apps and better longterm support. The Tab S9 FE is smaller and lighter. It offers additional protection with an IP 68 rating. It comes with a free S Pen, more storage, expandable storage, more capable multitasking, and better battery life. Now, you should see how the Tab S9 Ultra compares with the previous model. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.\n",

      "okay so I've made a short on this and I've made videos about these Monster tablets in the past and every single time people get really into them and I'm really into them but the question that always keeps coming up every time is are these actually iPad Killers like is an iPad killer a real thing so let's talk about it this is the newest highest end Android Tablet from Samsung the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra and it's even more ridiculous than the previous year's already crazy Ultra and I love it so I've already made a video on the tab S7 plus and then last year the tab S8 Ultra if you haven't already seen that I'll link it below that was last year's version and so now just like the rest of Samsung's recent announcements this new one mostly looks the same as last year's version but all the changes they've made are in the same direction just making it even more capable so you've got this gigantic 14.6 inch tablet that I mean it feels like I'm holding a small TV in my hands it somehow also razor thin with a huge battery inside and it actually doesn't snap in half despite looking like it probably should be susceptible to that but hey watch The X video for yourself if you don't believe me it survives better than a lot of other devices have this year though a new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy inside plus a new Vapor chamber cooling system under the hood so there's going to be an even higher ceiling for performance for everything it's already good at we've seen this thing do multitasking well for years and be quick to scroll around and open and close apps with normal usage and now it'll do better at gaming and video editing and potentially also last a bit longer on that same 11 200 milliamp hour battery that's bigger than any battery that's ever been in an iPad this year the quad speaker setup is also now made up of 20 larger speakers which is a pretty big jump and I'm not ready to call these the best sounding speakers in any tablet quite yet that's still that goes to the iPad Pro still but these sure do get really loud with very little Distortion and you can flip on Dolby Atmos audio if you want some pretty impressive surround sound effects for music or videos or games and then this entire tablet is now ip68 water and dust resistant for the first time which means it's safe to not just splash it with water but literally completely submerge the whole thing underwater and it'll be totally fine which is crazy I don't know any situation where you would end up with a tablet underwater maybe you're recklessly watching Netflix next to a pool or something and then you drop it in I don't know that but if you did it will still be fine but then on top of that this S Pen also comes in the Box again and this thing also now has an ip68 rating of its own and it also now supports bi-directional charging but not the bi-directional charging you're probably thinking of when you can accept charge from the tablet but also charge other things no I just mean whatever Direction the pen faces when you magnetize it to the back of the tablet it will work and charge perfectly fine which is better than last year what I'm surprised doesn't come in the box is any charging brick I mean for a tablet that does everything this thing is actually capable of 45 watt charging which is really solid but the only way to get that is to buy a charger something like this anchor Prime desktop charger which I would totally get over any Samsung first party charger because it's gallium nitride it's smaller and then it also has multi-port charging up to 240 Watts Max output so you could literally charge a laptop full speed and the tablet full speed at the same time but then of course they also make a really convenient battery Bank option so this this is the anchor Prime 250 watt battery bank with two USBC ports and one USB a port it has a built-in inductive wireless charging pad so that can charge the battery Bank up to 100 watts and then there's an app connected to it that lets you configure the display and optimize charging or even play a sound to find it it's way more advanced than any charger that's ever come in any Samsung bucks so shout out to anchor for sponsoring this video and I'll put a link in the description for you to check this one out right below that like button but the point is I mean you've seen all the specs now they're all huge numbers it's a 14 and a half inch screen in my hands it's 120 hertz it's an 11 200 milliamp hour battery it's quad speakers it's the minimum 12 gigs of RAM it's a terabyte of internal storage with up to another terabyte of micro SD card storage all these numbers are great but it's actually using this tablet and actually holding it it's it's hard to describe it to you but it's even more hilariously fun so I'm personally partial to like media idea consumption on devices like this like I would just want to watch YouTube videos on a gigantic screen take them with me download them offline watch them on flights with my free time like it's already amazing for that and honestly I think that's what most people do on tablets a lot of the time but of course for all the additional stuff that tablet power users are going to be doing there is just so much more that this thing is capable of basically it's at the Forefront of tablets there's all of Samsung's multi-window multitasking features and pop-up windows on that 16x10 aspect ratio display all of the stylus features which if you want to use a stylus on a tablet it feels like Samsung and Apple are really the only ones taking it seriously but you know I'm using it to sign documents every once in a while but there are some people whose entire workflows go through this thing and then you can't forget about decks there's a whole clever keyboard folio case that I didn't even have here for this one but I had it for the S8 Ultra and that adds a whole nother Dimension and Dex mode has been super used useful while giving you that desktop experience with independent windows and you can plug it into an even larger display if you want to it's more powerful than anything Apple has even tried to do on the iPad and all of that isn't even mentioning that this is probably the biggest camera viewfinder anyone has ever used Plus on the front that little Notch up there I've mentioned this before but there's two selfie cameras a front-facing normal camera and an ultra wide that can do auto framing in videos or in video calls similar to what Apple calls Center Stage except these cameras are actually in the right place on the long side of the tablet so all that being said can this be an iPad killer that's the question we keep asking and it's a good it's a real question like this is clearly competing against the iPad Pro the biggest baddest iPad Pro but it's going to have a lot of things a lot of features a lot of numbers to one-up the iPad Pro right it's got a bigger screen it's got bigger speakers it's got external expandable storage it's got the fingerprint reader that the iPad Pro doesn't have and all of that costs a hundred dollars more than the equivalent iPad Pro this reminds me of the conversation we've had about Sony phones like in the world of Android phones Sony is out here making incredibly well-equipped super high-end phones with a ton of Enthusiast features and expandable memory and manual controls that the competition like just straight up doesn't offer and that's only really at the expense of a little bit of automatic mode usability and price like they just they're expensive they cost more and while it's really easy to point out all the obvious benefits and advantages to all these extra features and these cool things that it does it turns out that the number of people who will actually take advantage of these features is Tiny and I mean they're everywhere on YouTube but when it comes to actually voting with their wallets most people end up just going with the sort of more standard one and I feel like there is a similar phenomenon Happening Here for whatever reason videos about these tablets do numbers they're they're going crazy like people love to see these on video and I like talking about them but then when it comes to actually buying them people uh the the ecosystem effect is way stronger than any uh YouTube comments would suggest people love flocking to the iPad for iMessage and FaceTime and all these other things but to keep it even more simple I like I have this analogy that I really like even better people like bigger screens as long as it doesn't sacrifice too much in the other areas of the device so take the MacBook Air for example that 13-inch MacBook Air was one of the best selling laptops for years it was Apple's number one best-selling laptop for a long time and people wanted a bigger screen but the only way that they could get a bigger screen and still buy an Apple product was to move all the way up to the 16-inch MacBook Pro which was just dramatically more expensive I mean it was Overkill most people did not need that much computer and so people would actually start to drift away and go buy a different slightly bigger screened laptop from some other company so much so that Apple finally this year decided to introduce a larger 15-inch MacBook Air and it turned out that's exactly what people wanted they just want the bigger screen on the other end of this apple tried introducing a mini iPhone for two whole years which you would think is a brilliant idea if you only read YouTube comments but again it turns out most people want the bigger screen and so that ended up not selling enough it got discontinued and today we have a plus phone instead so this is a bigger screen tablet than the iPad Pro which is why it's so amazing and impressive to hold and look at but it's also a very different tablet from the iPad Pro it's 100 bucks more but it's an Android tablet it has a whole different feature set and for a lot of people that's too much sacrifice and a lot of people will continue to just get iPads but for those who are not looped into the ecosystem and who don't depend on these features this is a hell of a tablet thanks for watching catch you in the next one peacehey everyone and welcome back to instant tech insights in this video we're not just talking about routers and

to share it with you thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next video- When Samsung released the Tab S9 FE and FE+, they made things really interesting. But at the same time, choosing which tablet to get might be more confusing, so let's break it down. To make things a little bit easier, let's put these tablets up into two categories: the fan edition models and the flagship models. And this makes sense because essentially the features are the same for every tablet in each category with a few exceptions. And here's a quick look at the starting prices. So starting out with the displays, both categories have an aspect ratio of 16:10, which makes them great for watching content. But in terms of specs, that's pretty much where the similarities end. The FE models have IPS/LCD displays, which offer a slower 90 hertz adaptive refresh rate with a good resolution and pixel density. All three flagship models have Dynamic AMOLED 2X displays, which offer a faster 120 hertz adaptive refresh rate, a higher resolution when comparing the same display sizes so you can see more content without having to scroll, and we're also getting a higher pixel density when comparing the same display sizes, which gives us a sharper image. And in terms of image quality, the FE displays are actually quite good, and I'm super happy with the image quality for watching video and for playing games. I also love that we're getting 90 hertz versus the 60 hertz we got on the Tab S7 FE, which was the last fan edition model. But there's no question that the dynamic AMOLED display on the flagship models is the better display. Colors seem to just pop right off the screen. We're getting outstanding blacks, better contrast, and the UI animations look smoother. Overall, the advantage in terms of image quality clearly goes to the flagship models. But keep in mind the cost because the flagship displays are not twice as good as the fan edition ones. Now all five tablets have a similar design with a full aluminum frame and back, but when comparing the tablets of the same size, the flagship models are thinner. Now, I love that Samsung was able to bring IP68 rating down to the FE version. This gives all the tablets protection from water and dust. Now, this is really nice if you take your tablet with you when you travel or if you take it to school with you every day. But it's also a super nice feature when you're using it around the house and you have a dog with a somewhat aggressive tail. Now, all five tablets offer face recognition for biometric authentication and a more secure fingerprint sensor. Now with the flagship models, we're getting an under display sensor, and with the FE models, it's integrated into the power button. Now, both sensors have worked really great for me, and they're super responsive and accurate. But I prefer the under display version because it's more natural to how I hold the tablet. All five tablets also have a micro SD card slot, so you can upgrade the internal storage by up to one terabyte. And you can use that storage for photos, for videos, for files, and for most apps. Now, continuing to look around the edges, we're getting four AKG-tuned speakers on the flagship models versus two on the FE. And the flagship models absolutely have a more full sound. The audio seems warmer, it has more presence to it, which actually makes them a better choice if you want to use the speakers on your tablet. Now, another factor to consider is the ability to expand the functionality of each tablet by adding a keyboard case and a stylus. Now since the form factor of the flagship and the FE models is so similar, the Tab S9 and FE are compatible with the same two versions of the book cover keyboards from Samsung. And the same is true for the FE+ and the Tab S9+. And then, of course, you can always use an external Bluetooth keyboard with all of these tablets. All five tablets also come with a free S pen, which can be stored on the side or on the back of the tablet. But only the flagship models come with a Bluetooth enabled S pen, which offers some wireless functionality for things like camera control and media playback. Now in terms of the actual writing experience, it's virtually identical and no charges required in order to write and draw. It's only needed for the Bluetooth functionality with the flagship models. Now, one of the areas where Samsung had to create some differentiation is with processing power, and there are several critical implications here. So the flagship models come with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and the FE models come with the Exynos 1380, so let's quickly look at the single and multi-core performance. And here we can see that the Snapdragon chip definitely pulls ahead. We also see it's scored considerably higher in GPU performance. Now, of course, these are just benchmark scores. So what kind of impact is this gonna have during typical real life use? Well, if you're just surfing the web, watching video, or going on social media, you're definitely gonna be able to do that with any of these tablets. But the flagship models definitely feel snappier and more responsive. And even if you're just navigating around the UI and opening and closing apps, you're going to notice the difference. And I would expect the flagship models to continue and perform better for longer because of the additional headroom in terms of performance. Now, of course, for more demanding things, like photo and video editing, the flagship models are a more capable option, but always keep in mind what you actually plan on doing because you are paying quite a bit more. Now, another area where I definitely noticed a meaningful difference is with gaming. I play a lot on my tablets, and I was really curious to see how these processors would match up. So I was able to play my usual games like PUBG, Genshin Impact, Asphalt, and then, of course, some less demanding games. But there was a very obvious difference in both processing power and GPU performance, which did have an impact on my overall experience with more resource intensive games. Now using PUBG as an example, gameplay was smoother and more responsive on the flagship models, and I could play with graphics set to smooth and frame rate set to 90 FPS. I could also set graphics anywhere from balanced to HDR and frame rate set to extreme or Ultra HD for graphics and Ultra for frame rate. With the FE models, I was limited to high frame rate, weather graphics were set to smooth, balanced, or HD, and that was as good as it got. So I definitely didn't get to use the 90 FPS. Now playing Genshin Impact, I had a very similar experience where it's playable on all five tablets, but it performed better on the flagship models, again, because of the more capable processor and the additional RAM, which I'll discuss in a minute. So if gaming is a priority for you now, then looking ahead, we know that game developers are always going to push the CPU and GPU, and games are going to evolve and start to demand more and more resources. When I look to keep a device for at least four to five years or even longer, I'm always going to opt for the tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance than what I need right now. And that way it will continue to perform better in the future. Now if you want to stream and play Xbox games with the Xbox Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox controller with all five tablets and then have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection. In terms of storage, the Tab S9 FE, the Tab S9, and the Tab S9 FE+ start out with 128 gigabytes. Then, the Tab S9+ and the Tab S9 Ultra start out with 256. So that's something that you want to keep in mind if you play a lot of games and you need more storage. Now looking at the camera systems, we're getting different setups and features depending on which model and category you go with. But in terms of the front facing camera, all three flagships have the same setup, and then the two FE models have the same setup. And here's a quick sample. This is a camera and microphone test of the Tab S9 and the Tab S9 FE. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect for video calls. Here's a camera and microphone test of the Tab S9+ and the Tab S9 FE+. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect. Now, the Tab S9+ looks a little overexposed to me. All I did was press record, I didn't change any of the settings. The color is also definitely different on the FE+. It seems like a much warmer image and probably a better exposure, which is really interesting. Now, all five tablets run the latest Android and One UI, so you're getting all of the latest features, like three tiled apps, pop-up windows, and then, of course, decks, which is awesome. So essentially, it reboots the tablet and gives you an operating system that's very similar to a desktop OS. You're getting a task bar, a desktop with icons, multiple windows, you can snap windows, and you can use a keyboard case to transform your tablet into more of a laptop replacement. Now if you use decks, you can connect a keyboard and mouse to all five tablets. But one massive difference is that you can only connect an external display and run a dual display setup with the flagship models. The FE models don't have this ability. You can, however, use each of the five tablets as an additional display for your laptop or desktop with Samsung's Second Screen. And this is a super handy feature for me both in the office and when I travel. Now as far as OS and security updates, Samsung promised four years of OS updates and five years of security updates, which is nice. And again, keep in mind the difference in performance if you plan on keeping your tablet for a while. Now, in terms of battery life, we're getting larger battery sizes as we go up in tablet size. And you can check out this video if you wanna see a detailed battery drain test. Now, all five tablets offer 45 watts, super fast charging, but none of them ship with a charging adapter. So that's something you'll need to get separately. Now when we look at the configuration options, it's important that we look both at the RAM and storage options in the base and upgraded models. And remember that while only the Tab S9 Ultra is offered with one terabyte, you can expand the internal storage on all five tablets with a micro SD card. And there's no question that the flagship models are more capable. They have better display, a much more powerful chip with better CPU and GPU performance, better speakers, a better camera system, and a more capable S pen. But if you're on a budget and you don't need the best, the FE models are an outstanding value, and you're still getting a very good display, IP68 rating, a free S pen, and a lot of the same features for significantly less money. Now, you should check out the battery drain test. You know what I always say. Buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.- Okay, so you've got about 300 bucks, you are looking for a new tablet, and you're asking yourself, \"Which one is actually better, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 or the entry-level iPad 9?\" When we look at the design, we immediately see some important differences. The iPad 9 still has the older style design with larger bezels on the top and the bottom and a Home button. In contrast, the Tab 8 has a more modern design with smaller bezels all the way around, which give it a cleaner look. It also means that although both tablets are about the same size, we're getting a larger 10.5-inch display on the Tab A8 versus 10.2 inches on the iPad 9. Now, looking around the edges, both tablets have power buttons, volume controls, and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, which I'll come back to later on. For charging and accessories, the iPad 9 still uses the older Lightning port while the Tab A8 uses a USB-C port. Now, personally, I'm stuck with both types of cables because my iPhone, my 3rd Generation AirPods, and even my AirPods Max still use a Lightning cable. And at the same time, my Fold 3, all my Galaxy Tablets, my Buds Live, my Galaxy Book 360, and my MacBooks all use USB-C. So I'm gonna have both types of cables all over the house regardless. So for me, it doesn't really make a difference. But if all your other devices use USB-C, keep in mind that you'll need a dedicated cable for the iPad 9. And in general, USB-C is a more powerful and more versatile port. Now, another advantage of the Tab A8 is that it has a microSD card slot, which allows you to expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. Now, this is great if you wanna keep a ton of photo and video files on your tablet, but keep in mind that this storage is essentially only used for files and not for apps. It's still a factor because the files that you store on the microSD card aren't taking up any of your internal storage, whereas on the iPad 9, everything including photos and video has to be stored locally. Finally, the Tab A8 has 4 speakers versus only 2 on the iPad 9. And there are some significant implications to this, which I'll cover in the gaming section. All around, when it comes to design, I'm going to give the edge to the Tab A8. And as far as portability, I'm gonna call it a tie. And another important difference is biometric authentication. So the iPad 9 uses Touch ID with the Home button while the Tab A8 uses face recognition with the front-facing camera. I'm not gonna say that one is definitively better than the other because it comes down to how you use your tablet. And ultimately, if I had my choice, I'd want both options like we have with the Tab S7. Now, probably one of the most important aspects of any tablet is the display. There are a few things that we wanna talk about, and let's also talk about how specs impact real-life use. With the Tab A8, we're getting a 10.5-inch display with a resolution of 1920 x 1200, a 16:10 aspect ratio, and a pixel density of 216 pixels per inch. The iPad 9 has a smaller display at 10.2 inches but a higher resolution of 2160 x 1620, an aspect ratio of 4:3, and a higher pixel density of 265 PPI. And the Tab A8 gives you a slightly wider display when you're watching content. And the aspect ratio is closer to the 16:9 that you get from a lot of videos, so there are smaller black bars on the top and the bottom. The iPad 9's higher resolution means that you can fit more information on the display at once. So for example, if you're looking at a webpage, you'll see more of the content without having to scroll. Additionally, the aspect ratio of 4:3 is very useful when you're taking notes or drawing with the Apple Pencil in Portrait Mode because we're getting a wider canvas. The iPad 9 also has a fingerprint-resistant coating, which makes a noticeable difference. It's not that it won't pick up fingerprints at all, but it definitely stays cleaner than the Tab A8. And I find myself not having to clean it as often with a microfiber cloth. Now, both are 60 hertz displays, but there are fundamental differences in the types of display that each tablet has. The iPad 9 does not have a fully laminated display, meaning that there is an air gap. On the Tab A8, the display, the touch layer, and the cover glass are fused into a single display assembly. For things like gaming, surfing the web, using various productivity apps, or watching video, you're unlikely to notice this difference. But in general, I prefer a fully laminated display because the image looks like it's painted right on top of the glass. A fully laminated display is typically also better when you're using a stylus because the tip of the pencil looks like it's touching the content that's being created. Whereas on the iPad 9, you will see a bit of separation. Now, in this particular case, while the iPad 9 is compatible with the 1st Generation Apple Pencil, the Tab A8 isn't compatible at all with Samsung's S Pen. So you can't use the Bluetooth-enabled S Pen that you get with a Tab S7 or S7 Plus or even the basic S Pen that you get with a Tab S7 FE. Now, both displays work just fine for everything that I do from watching content to playing games, surfing the web, and using various apps. If the larger black bars when watching video are an issue for you, then the Tab A8 is a better fit. Personally, they don't bother me at all. And for everyday use, I prefer the sharper and higher resolution display on the iPad 9, as well as the fingerprint-resistant coating, the 4:3 aspect ratio, and the Apple Pencil compatibility for note-taking, sketching, and for marking up and signing documents. If you're looking for more of a laptop-like experience, then you may wanna pick up a keyboard case. Now, the iPad 9 has a ton of excellent options from Apple and from third-party providers. I have not been able to find a dedicated keyboard case from Samsung for the Tab A8, but I did find this other option that has a removable keyboard. And I'll share a link in the description. It's actually kind of neat because you can use the same case with and without the keyboard. When we look at processing power, we've got benchmarks, and then we have real-life use. For single-core performance, the Tab A8 score 364 versus 1330 on the iPad 9. And for multi-core performance, we're looking at 1250 versus 3376. So we're getting substantially better performance on the iPad 9 for pretty much any type of task. But the real question is, does this have any kind of real-life implications for the majority of users? And in this case, the answer is a resounding yes. Like whether you're opening and closing apps, switching between opened apps or between opened tabs in your browser, or just navigating around the UI, the iPad 9 is extremely responsive. In comparison, the Tab A8 feels sluggish, laggy, and it feels underpowered for a current device. Now, that's not to say that you can't perform the same tasks, it's just that the user experience is not as smooth. And sometimes you're not sure if the Tab A8 is lagging or if a tap or a swipe wasn't registered. I'll get to how this impacts the gaming experience in just a moment. But first, let's talk about the camera and speakers. Now, this is another area where it's a split decision. Looking at the rear-facing cameras, both are eight megapixels, but the iPad 9 camera is simply better. It's more color accurate. It has better dynamic range. And it's more versatile in terms of features, frame rates, and image stabilization. I very rarely use the rear-facing cameras on my tablets because the ones on my phones are so much better. So for me, the more important camera on a tablet is the front-facing one, which I use for video calls. Again, the iPad 9 comes out ahead with a 12 megapixel camera versus 5 megapixels on the Tab A8. It's also an Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage, which is a feature that uses artificial intelligence to identify then track a subject as it moves through the frame. It can then crop the image to give the impression that the camera is following the subject. So in both cases, if you're looking for the better camera system, that's gonna be the iPad 9. When we get to the speakers, things shift in favor of the Tab A8. The iPad 9 only has speakers on the bottom. So when you're holding it in Landscape Mode, the audio only comes out to one side. It actually does a pretty good job at projecting the sound, but it can't compete with the Tab A8. The four-speaker Dolby Atmos system has better audio quality. It offers more immersive and fuller stereo sound. And it's better for games, where you need to detect which direction footsteps or other sounds come from. Before we get to battery life and gaming, let's talk about multitasking apps and operating system support. So for multitasking, I'm going to give the edge to the iPad 9. Both tablets have similar features, but again, the iPad 9 feels more responsive. And working with multiple apps feels seamless. The iPad 9 can also be used as an additional display for your Mac, your iMac, or your MacBook with a feature called Sidecar. Now, Samsung has a similar feature called Second Screen, but it's not available on the Tab A8. Now, looking at the app selections, both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store are full of choices for pretty much everything you wanna do. There are some specific popular creative apps like LumaFusion, Procreate and Affinity Photo that are only available on the iPad. LumaFusion did announce that they'll be releasing an Android version, so that's good news. As far as operating system support, Samsung promises three generations of OS updates. Now in contrast, Apple provides much longer support. And just as an example, my iPad Air 2, which I got eight years ago, is still supported by iPadOS 15. And moving on to battery life, both tablets have pretty good performance. And for the most part, I can get through an entire day with both. Of course, I can't sit down and play eight hours straight of \"PUBG\" without having to recharge either one of them. But for the most part, for what I do every day, I get through a full day. The iPad 9 probably does get the edge here, and I'm currently working on a more detailed test. When it comes to gaming, I'm able to play all of my games on both tablets. Less-demanding games are going to pretty much play on any current tablet, so that's not really an issue. But even more demanding games like \"PUBG\" and \"COD Mobile\" ran smoothly on both. For \"PUBG,\" on the Tab A8, I was able to set graphics to smooth or balanced, and then the frame rate to ultra. I could also set the graphics to HD, and then the frame rate to high. With the iPad 9, I could go all the way up to 90 frames per second with the graphic set to smooth. I could go up to extreme frame rate with balanced graphics or all the way up to ultra HD with frame rate set to ultra. Now, switching to \"COD Mobile,\" the Tab A8 tops out at medium graphic quality and high frame rate while the iPad 9 can go to very high graphic quality and max frame rate or very high graphic quality and very high frame rate. So in both games, the iPad 9 has the better options. Now, we talked a little bit about the audio early on in the video. But if you plan on using your speakers to play games where you need directional sound, the Tab A8 will perform better. Now, both tablets have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, which gives you the option of using a wired gaming headset for perfect lag-free audio. It also means that you can charge the tablet and use the wired headset at the same time without needing any type of adapter or a splitter. Both tablets also worked great with an Xbox controller and Xbox Game Pass. And I was able to play all of my favorite games as long as I had a fast and stable internet connection. I'm going to give the slight edge to the iPad 9 because in my opinion, it has a better display, and I had less issues with the controller disconnecting. Now, I wanna talk about the different configurations and also address resale value. I'll be using the prices from the Samsung and Apple Stores, but you can usually find better prices by using the links in the description. The Tab A8 is available with 32 gigabytes of storage and 3 gigs of RAM for 230 bucks, then 64 gigabytes for $280, and 128 gigabytes of storage for $330. And both of those models come with four gigabytes of RAM. The iPad 9 comes with either 64 gigabytes for 329 or 256 for 459. And both of them come with three gigabytes of RAM. So both tablets are also available on cellular models. And remember that the Tab A8 has a microSD card slot. It can be used to expand the internal storage and that this storage will be used for files and not for apps. Now, one thing to keep in mind, is that at least in the US, the iPads hold their resale value for longer. And at the same time, Samsung has some really great trade-in options. And I'd love to know what the situation is where you live. So which one of these tablets is a better option for you? So the Tab A8 starts at $230 for 32 gigabytes of internal storage. Although I would really only recommend that to someone who's just using it to stream content, to surf the web, work with some basic apps, and then play a few small games. If we're comparing the $330 models, then the Tab A8 comes with 120 gigs of internal storage, plus the microSD card slot, which can expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. It has a more modern design, facial recognition, a nice display, and a better speaker system. The iPad 9 comes with 64 gigabytes of internal storage. It can be upgraded to 256 for an additional $130, has a better display, Touch ID, Apple Pencil support, a better camera system. It's noticeably more powerful and more responsive, and it has better graphic performance for gaming. Now, you should see how the iPad 9 compares with the Galaxy Tab S7 FE. Hopefully, this video was helpful. Click on my face to subscribe. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.- Okay, so you're thinking of buying a Galaxy Tab S9 series tablet and you realize that there are three great options, but Samsung actually did something this year to make the decision even harder. So let's talk about all the important differences. This way you can have all the information that you need to choose the right Tab S9 series tablet for you. Starting out, we have the Tab S9 which got the most significant changes in this year's lineup. It retails for 799, and right now, using the links in the description, you can actually double the storage and get 50% more RAM for the same price, but we'll come back to that later. So over the past few years, Samsung didn't give the best displays to the smallest versions, like the Tab S7 and the Tab S8. It was still a very nice display, but it was an LCD display. Now, this year, the Tab S9 got the same upgrade as its two bigger siblings, and now it's sporting an amazing dynamic AMOLED 2X display. It's an 11-inch 120 hertz display with a resolution of 1,600 by 2,560, a 16 by 10 aspect ratio, and 274 pixels per inch. The display gives you the choice between a static 60 hertz or adaptive 120 hertz where the tablet changes in real time based on what you're doing. And this way you can save on battery life when you're looking at static content and you can get smooth and responsive animations when you're interacting with a UI, playing games, or doing anything else where a faster refresh rate offers the optimal user experience. This display has noticeably darker black levels than the previous models. It has better color accuracy, better contrast, and reduced blue light emission. The Tab S9 comes in graphite or beige. And looking around the edges, we see four speaker grills with four AKG-tuned speakers. In terms of audio quality, they're quite good for this size tablet and they work well for watching content and for games that don't require you to quickly identify where sounds are coming from. Obviously, for those types of games, you're better off using headsets, and there's a speaker test of all three tablets later on in this video when I talk about the Tab S9 Ultra. Now back to the Tab S9, we're getting a USB-C for charging and connecting accessories, and there's a micro SD cart slot which allows you to expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. Now, speaking of accessories, the Tab S9 comes with a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen. We're getting lower latency than last year's model, and it has bidirectional charging, so it doesn't matter which way you snap it to the back. Both the tablet and the S Pen have an IP68 rating, so you're getting protection from water and dust. And the Tab S9 is compatible with two keyboard cases from Samsung, the Book Cover Keyboard and the Book Cover Keyboard Slim. For biometric authentication, we got another upgrade from last year, and now we've got an outstanding under display fingerprint sensor to go along with facial recognition. This year, we also got a really impressive upgrade in performance with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, which has better single core performance in the last year's model and even greater improvement in multi-core and GPU performance. And the new Qualcomm chip also helps improve battery life. So on top of getting a larger battery this year at 8,400 milliampere-hour versus 8,000, we're also getting a more efficient chip. And I'm finishing up a detailed battery drain test of all three models. I'll also put the Tab S8 series test in the description if you want to check out those results. The Tab S9 gives us outstanding multitasking capabilities with three tiled apps at the same time, popup windows, and then of course DeX. If you're not familiar with it, DeX essentially reboots the tablet and gives you an operating system that's very similar to a desktop OS. You're getting a task bar, a desktop with icons, multiple windows. You can snap windows, and you can use a keyboard case to transform your tablet into more of a laptop replacement. You can also connect an external display keyboard and mouse and then run a super capable dual display setup. Now, one other great option is to use the Tab S9 as an additional display for your laptop or desktop with Samsung's Second Screen. This is a super handy feature when you travel. For cameras, we're getting a 13-megapixel front-facing camera and a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera. And for connectivity, we're getting Wi-Fi 6E compatibility just like with the two larger models. Looking at the configuration options, the 128-gigabyte model comes with eight gigs of RAM, and the 256-gigabyte model comes with 12 gigs of RAM. And remember that you can use the links in the description to get that upgrade for free, which is something that I would highly recommend doing. Ultimately, this is an extremely powerful and capable tablet at this price point. It's also a great option for someone who values portability, for users who prefer this size for gaming, or for users with smaller hands who find a smaller tablet easier to handle. Moving onto the Tab S9+, which starts out at $999. We're essentially getting the same design, but in a larger form factor. We're now getting the same type of display, dynamic AMOLED 2X, but it's larger at 12.4 inches. We're getting a higher resolution at 1,752 by 2,800, the same aspect ratio of 16 by 10, and a slightly lower pixel density, but not something that's really noticeable in terms of sharpness. Now, watching content on this display is fantastic. The image quality is outstanding. And since the aspect ratio is so close to the image that's being displayed, they're very small black bars at the top and the bottom. Also, if you fill to zoom, you're getting a very minor crop and then the image covers the entire display and looks great. Again, we're getting four AKG-tuned speakers, but these are warmer and fuller than the ones on the Tab S9. We're getting the same USB-C 3.2 ports, same Bluetooth 5.3, and Wi-Fi 6E compatibility, but a larger battery than the Tab S9 at 10,090 milliampere-hour. And like all three tablets, we're getting fast wire charging at 45 watts. Now, keep in mind that none of these tablets come with a charger, and I'll put some links in the description to a few of my favorites. We have the same options for biometric authentication with an under-display fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. We're getting the same S Pen with the same low latency, and the same IP68 protection for the S Pen and the tablet. Now, even though we have the same multitasking features, the larger display on the Tab S9+ gives the edge over the smaller Tab S9, and that's true for multiple tiled apps, for DeX, and when we're using it as an external display. When it comes to gaming, this model might be the sweet spot in terms of size. You're getting a larger display, but it's not too big, so it's great for handheld games and when you wanna connect to controller, and then stream some games using the Xbox Game Pass app. It has the same 13-megapixel front-facing camera as the Tab S9. But in addition to the 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, it also has an eight-megapixel ultra wide. We're getting the same powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, but the Tab S9+ starts with 256 gigabytes and 12 gigs if RAM. And again, right now you can double the storage and get the 512 gigabyte model for the same price. The Tab S9+ is right there in the middle. It's giving you a noticeably larger display, a slightly better camera module, better speakers, a larger battery, and more storage. All right, so now we move on to the Tab S9 Ultra, which starts out at $1,199. It's the biggest tablet that Samsung makes, and it's what some people would say is inarguably the best display on any tablet. Now, whether you agree or not, if you've had a chance to use this tablet in real life, you have to admit that this display is spectacular. It's massive at 14.6 inches, still dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120 hertz. It has the highest resolution at 1,848 by 2,960 the same 16 by 10 aspect ratio, and a pixel density of 239. Now, surprisingly, the Tab S9 Ultra is the thinnest of all three tablets. It's not by a lot, but when you couple the larger size with the thinnest tablet, the user experience is that of using some sort of a futuristic display. I'll admit that it's probably not for everyone. It's definitely the least portable option, although, honestly, for me, I always carry it in my backpack. So it doesn't really impact me in that context, but there is one specific area where it's actually too big, and I'll get to that in just a minute. And we're getting all the same biometric features the same connectivity, same IP68 rating, but we do see another change when it comes to the camera module. So we have the 13-megapixel wide and the eight-megapixel ultra wide that we saw on the Tab S9+ on the back of the tablet. But on the front we're now getting two 13-megapixel cameras with a wide and an ultra wide. We're also getting a small notch which is something that I feel like I have to address. So I've heard both sides of the argument and my perspective in short is that it just doesn't matter. The display is so big and the notch is like this big. It's so tiny that I never really notice it. Now, of course, if it's something that you're gonna be fixated on, then it's not really the tablet for you and you should probably go with something like the Tab S9+. But it's just never really been an issue or in the way for any of the ways that I use this tablet. The Tab S9 Ultra is right now my favorite tablet to watch content on. The fact that I can get an image to be this big, this close to me is super impressive. We're also getting the best audio quality using the built-in speakers. And here's a quick sample from all three tablets. (\"On & On\") ♪ Hold me close 'til I get up ♪ ♪ Time is barely on our side ♪ ♪ I don't wanna waste what's left ♪ ♪ The storms we chase are leading us ♪ ♪ And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah ♪ ♪ No, I don't wanna waste what's left ♪ ♪ And on and on we'll go ♪ ♪ Through the wastelands, through the highways ♪ ♪ 'Til my shadow turns to sun rays ♪ ♪ And on and on we'll go ♪ ♪ Through the wastelands, through the highways ♪ ♪ And on and on we'll go ♪ - We're getting the largest battery of all three at 11,200 milliampere-hours, but of course it has to power the largest display, so I'm super excited to show you my battery test, and make sure that you're subscribed so you don't miss out. For multitasking DeX and second screen, this is the best option because it's such a useful size and you can have so much content on it and you can really improve your productivity. Now, the one area where this tablet was too big for me was when I'm playing \"PUBG\" and holding it in the air. It just feels cumbersome and my hands get pretty tired after a couple games. Now, if you play with a tablet flat on the desk or on a pillow, then that's another completely different story. And in that case, I love having the larger display because it's easier to see smaller movements. It's definitely the best tablet to use with a controller because it's like having a super light and portable TV with you anywhere you go. For configuration options, it starts out with 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 12 gigs of RAM. And again, you can double the storage right now for the same price. And if you go to one terabyte, you also get bumped up to 16 gigabytes of RAM. If you want the biggest tablet with the biggest display for watching content, if you multitask, use your tablet as a laptop replacement with DeX, or use it for second screen, and if you want the largest gaming display Samsung offers in a tablet, get yourself a Tab S9 Ultra. It's probably my favorite tablet in the lineup. And this display just puts a smile on my face every time I use it. And whenever a new person sees me using it for the first time, it's super obvious that there is something very special about this tablet. Now you should check out this comparison. Hopefully this video is helpful. Click on my face to subscribe. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.hello everyone preview i order at shopee- All right, so here are my predictions for this battery test. I've got my coffee here, I've got all five Tab S9 tablets. They're all fully charged and ready to go. I matched the brightness levels on all five. I've got my time already, so let's get started. And the first thing we're gonna do is a couple of hours of watching YouTube. And what I like to do during these tests is run the tablets through the types of things that I do every day. So things like watching video, gaming, recording and rendering videos, going on social media, and then streaming. And this way, we can get a sense of how these tablets perform. Now, naturally, this is not a perfectly controlled scientific experiment, but it's designed to give you an idea of how these tablets compare. Now, when we look at the displays, we have essentially two categories. The two FE models have an IPS LCD display and the three flagship models have a dynamic AMOLED 2X display. And it'll be interesting to see if that has an impact on battery life. Now, looking at sizes, we've got the 10.9 inches on the Tab S9 FE, 11 inches on the Tab S9, 12.4 inches on the FE+ and S9+, and then the giant 14.6-inch display on the Ultra. There's also a difference in terms of refresh rate, with the FE models having 90 hertz adaptive refresh rate versus 120 hertz adaptive refresh rate on the flagship models. Now, checking in with the tablets after about an hour of use, the Tab S9 Ultra has a slight lead; followed by the Plus and the Tab S9, which are very close to each other; and then the FE+; and then last place, the FE. As far as processing power, the two FE models use the Exynos 1380 and the three flagship tablets use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip. And in terms of overall performance, the Snapdragon chip outperforms the Exynos. Next, when I wanna have some fun and play something relaxing, \"Alien Shooter\" is a great option. Now, typically, I play games like \"Genshin,\" \"COD: Mobile,\" and \"PUBG,\" so they're really two choices to make here. First, the Snapdragon chip is much more powerful. So I'm able to play games with higher graphics and FPS settings. And next, I always take into account the size of the device. For example, if you play PUBG, the Ultra is great because everything looks bigger and it's easier to see other players or someone trying to snipe you from behind a tree. And if you play with the tablet flat on a pillow, that works great, but if you're holding the tablet up the entire time, it gets heavy, and one of the smaller options might be more comfortable. When I want to connect an Xbox controller and then stream games with the Xbox Game Pass app, then again, I always grab the Ultra because the 14.6-inch display is absolutely amazing. Now, the two FE models have two AKG-tuned speakers versus four on the flagship model. And there's no question that the flagship models have better overall sound. Now, unfortunately, none of them come with a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack. So if you want to use wired headphones or a headset, you need to get an adapter or use a USB-C headset. And in terms of battery life, we begin to see just a bit more separation. Again, the Ultra is in first place, followed by the Plus and the Tab S9, then the FE+, and we can see that the FE continues to fall behind. Now, next, let's see what happens when we put these two chips to work and render some 4K video. We're over 2 1/2 hours into the test. I fired up PowerDirector and then rendered a 4K version of one of my videos. We can immediately see that the Snapdragon chip is more powerful, as it finishes the render much more quickly. I also noticed that the Tab S9+ seems to be consistently slower than the Tab S9 and the Tab S9 Ultra. I'm not really sure why, but that's really surprising. I had to run this render over and over again because I wanted to do it for a prolonged period of time. And that type of performance with the Tab S9+ compared to the other two was consistent. Now let's see what happens when we shoot 4K footage with the front-facing cameras. Now, the camera setups are not identical, but all are 12 megapixels and I'm shooting 30 minutes of 4K 30. Now, if you've watched any of my reviews, you know that I very rarely use the rear-facing cameras on my tablets because I'm always gonna have at least one of my phones with me and it's just so much more convenient to use. But, the cameras are actually quite good. After I finished recording, I decided to watch a little Netflix, and we can continue to see the flagship models separating from the FE models, and we can also see that I'm nowhere close to being able to go to bed. While Netflix is playing, let's talk a little bit more about these displays. So all five have an aspect ratio of 16x10, so there are very small black bars at the top and the bottom when you're playing movies. All five are fully laminated, so there's no air gap when you use the S Pen, and the tip of the stylus looks like it's touching the content that's being created. I also love the fact that Samsung includes an S Pen with all five tablets. This way, you don't need to spend any additional money in order to get the most out of your tablets. Now, the image quality is very good on all five displays. The video is sharp and crisp, but I do prefer the dynamic AMOLED 2X displayed on the flagship models because the blacks are darker, the image seems more vibrant, and then of course animations look smoother because of the faster refresh rate. But, to be totally fair, the FE displays look great, especially for the price, and it's really just when you have them side by side that you can really tell the difference. And if you made me choose my favorite display of all five, that's easily the Tab S9 Ultra. It's everything that I loved about the Tab S8 Ultra, just better. And this is probably my favorite tablet ever to watch content on. Now, in terms of resolution, we're looking at 2304x1440 on the FE, 2560x1600 on the Tab S9 and the FE+, 2800x1752 on the Plus, and 2960x1848 on the Ultra. Now, higher resolution doesn't really matter to me when I'm watching content, but it is important to me when I'm multitasking. So on top of being able to see more content without having to scroll on the Ultra, it's also the best option when I have two or three apps open side by side because I have so much more room to work with. All right, so we're now six hours into the test. The Tab S9 Ultra is in the lead, followed by the Tab S9+ and the Tab S9, which are neck and neck. Then, we have the FE+, which is well ahead of the FE. Next, I checked out some Instagram Reels. And starting with the unboxing of the S24 Ultra, and followed by some tips and tricks on the Galaxy Z Fold5, and then a quick click at the current state of my new gaming room. Now, there's a ton of gaming content coming on this channel, so if there's anything specific that you want me to cover, just let me know in the comment section. Now, as far as pricing, the Tab S9 FE starts at 450 bucks; the Tab S9, 800 bucks; the FE+ at 600; the Plus at $1,000; and then the Ultra starts at 1,200 bucks. But, we're getting different base internal storage and RAM options. Now, all five tablets come with a micro SD card slot so you can expand the internal storage without having to pay a premium. Now, back to the battery. Once again this year, I'm so impressed with the fact that this far into the test, we still have so much battery life left. The Ultra is maintaining the lead, followed closely by the Plus and the Tab S9, and then we see a gap before we get to the FE+ and then another gap before going to the FE. All right, so now we're more than seven hours into this test. I'm extremely tired. I definitely should have started this test earlier in the day. But as I do with the end of every test, I'm going to play YouTube videos until each and every one of these tablets runs out of battery. I've got a playlist of some of my absolute favorite creators, so let the games begin. And it's super interesting to see the difference between the Tab S9+ and the FE+ since they have the same-size battery. In terms of actual battery size, we're looking at 8,000 milliamp per hour on the FE, 8,400 on the Tab S9, 10,090 on the FE+ and the Plus, and then 11,200 on the Ultra. All five tablets are capable of 45 watt fast charging, but none of them comes with a power adapter, so I'd recommend that you pick up a high-capacity charger. Now, personally, I'm very rarely gonna use my tablet for this long without having access to a power outlet, but if I do, I always bring a power bank. And if you're looking for some great options, check out a few of my accessory videos. All right, so the Tab S9 was the first to run out at seven hours and 22 minutes into this test. Now, even though it comes in at fifth place, it's still very good battery life, especially because the vast majority of users aren't going to use that type of tablet to film and render 4K video during a typical day. In fourth place, we have the Tab S9 FE+, at eight hours and 21 minutes. Again, I was super interested in how it would compare with the Tab S9+ because they have the same size battery and the same size display, but they have different chips and different types of displays. And in third place, we have the Tab S9, at nine hours and 36 minutes, followed very closely by the Tab S9+ at nine hours and 39 minutes. It looks like Samsung did a really good job at matching the battery size to the display size since both of these have the same type of display and the same chip. And now, we have lone survivor, the Tab S9 Ultra. And I'm kind of surprised that it's going to win this contest, and I'm curious to see how far it can go. All right, so after nine hours and 44 minutes, the Tab S9 Ultra finally died, and it's only a few minutes longer than the Plus and the Tab S9. So did I get the order correctly? Not at all. I thought that the higher-end Snapdragon chip would use up more energy and that the dynamic AMOLED 2X display would do the same. I also thought that the Tab S9 would outlast the Plus, and I definitely didn't expect the Tab S9 Ultra to perform this well, especially after last year's test. I absolutely love what Samsung did with the Tab S9 lineup, bringing the higher-end display to all three flagship models and while still releasing two FE models for users who don't need the absolute best display or the most processing power. And if you're looking for more information about any of these tablets, I have dedicated reviews and comparisons. So check them out. My name is Sagi, click on my face to subscribe.

      "Hello and welcome to Revie wsPK! My name is Ameer and this is Xiaomi's latest Redmi Pad SE which is a budget tablet from Xiaomi. If you remember we did an unboxing of Redmi Pad, this is a basically a water down version of that. Only a single variant is launching in Pakistan for Rs. 62,000 which has 8GB RAM and 128GB storage so, some specs have been reduced here keeping the budget in mind we will talk about that in today's video first, let's quickly unbox it. As soon as we open the box, our Redmi Pad is at the top in this fabric cover. As always, some main selling points of the device are mentioned on this cover which makes this device look like a media consumption and productivity device to me to watch videos and movies and to do office emails etc. Along with this, we get a charger cable and power brick in the box and some user manuals And here is our device. Redmi Pad SE's design and feel is exactly like the original Redmi Pad today, we have it in Graphite Grey colour it is also made of Unibody Aluminium which means, it's body is made of a single piece of Aluminium and it has the same soft brushed matte finish and the edges are kept flat. It is very. obvious that this tablet is inspired by some other world famous tablets even beyond the look, this Redmi Pad impresses with its design it's thickness is 7.4mm which is not too thick and it's weight is 478g. Moving forward to the display Redmi Pad SE's display is 11 inches in size it is slightly bigger than the last time it is also an IPS LCD panel and the most special thing about it is it has a 90Hz high refresh rate which makes the overall experience of this tablet smoother the second special thing is its resolution it is a Full HD display which shows 207 ppi pixel density which is slightly less than the current iPad Air the screen to body ratio is 81% and this is also almost the same as the iPad Air And as far as the brightness is concerned it has a peak brightness of 400 nits which is not too much if you take it out in the sun, you will feel that the display is not able to be seen easily but you won't have any issues using it indoors. But overall, I do like this display while watching video. and movies in daily use the experience of Redmi Pad SE is very enjoyable and it also has Widevine L1 support so, apps like Netflix will be able to show content in Full HD And then, friends, here Xiaomi has also taken special care of the audio experience because in Redmi Pad SE, there are quad speakers like last time two at the bottom and two at the top so, the stereo audio scene is on and Dolby Atmos has also been added here to give a surround sound effect. Now, let's take a look under the hood so, here there is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 chipset it is a 4G chipset and is based on a 6nm architecture and it is normally an entry-level type of chipset along with it, there is Adreno 610 GPU there is 8GB RAM and 128GB built-in storage But there is also an SD card expansion available here if you want to increase the storage of this tablet or if you want to bring your files on it, you can do that as well Now, the first thing is that where the original Redmi Pad was designed for gamers as well there, this Redmi Pad SE at best, will handle casual gaming RAM is enough here but this Snapdragon 680 chip is not that powerful it is now considered as a budget level or even entry-level chipset Having said that, as I told you earlier I consider this Redmi Pad SE as a media content consumption or as a productivity device. and it is fine for both those tasks the experience of watching videos and movies is very solid here it can easily do emails, messaging and word processing and then, a giant battery of 8000 mAh is also given here which is a big selling point for a tablet of this size because in this size, you usually see a battery of 7000 to 7250 mAh so, you can expect a very good battery life from this Redmi Pad SE. Also, keep in mind that it has a Snapdragon 680 chipset which also does not drain the battery much but in charging, this Redmi Pad SE. takes a lot of time, because the power brick that comes with it charges it only at 10W which means that this tablet will charge easily and there are chances that you will have to charge it overnight if you try to charge it in the middle of the day then it will take a lot of time Now, moving forward, let's talk about the cameras and let's face it people do not use the cameras of tablets a lot so, there is a very entry-level setup in the cameras there is a 5MP selfie camera at the front which is centrally aligned so, you will use it in horizontal orientation I like that! whereas, at the back, there is a 8MP single main camera I do not mind its back camera much but it would have been better if the front camera was a little more than 5MP because nowadays, a lot of people use their tablets for video conferencing and zoom calls so, if the camera is not of good quality, then it is not fun but according to me, most people will use these cameras occasionally Now, at the end, we will talk about the software of this device because for a tablet, its software is also very important. and the requirements of such a big screen are very different from a small screen so, in this interface, Redmi has added a little more features than its mobile interface here is Xiaomi's MIUI 14 on top of Android 13 and its look is something like this there is a dock at the bottom where you can put your frequently used apps if you drag it from top right, then a quick settings comes up and notifications come from top left you can also turn on app drawer by going to home screen settings by swiping up on the home screen, all your apps will come and this interface is designed for tablets so, multitasking is also kept in mind here and you can use apps in split screen mode and the floating windows feature is also present and through these features, you can take advantage of this big screen in the right way So, friends, I think, overall, Xiaomi has given an entry level but useful product with its Redmi Pad SE I really liked its Unibody Aluminium design. its experience for content consumption is also amazing, And it has a huge battery, so, you can use it more According to me, this type of tablet is great for travelling, and great for students, or if you only want to watch movies, this can help you on that as well, but now I want to know your thoughts, what do you think about Redmi Pad SE do leave your opinion in the comments below. If you liked the video, then do share it with your friends if you want to support the channel, then do share it even more Thank you so much for watching till the end I will meet you in the next video Goodbye!the Xiaomi brand doesn't need any introduction these days the latest affordable tablet marketed under the Redmi brand carries a simple name - it's just a Redmi Pad in today's video I'm going to show you everything you want to know about Xiaomi Redmi Pad which thanks to its core components represents absolutely fantastic value we'll discuss the external design and the core components of the Redmi Pad I'll test the cameras and check the gaming performance and I will show you through the main features of the Redmi Pad and hopefully this video will answer all your questions - so stay with me hi what's up guys - my name is Adam - and you're watching #FamilyPopTV YouTube channel first let's check what's in the box inside a neat packaging we can find a Redmi Pad itself a 15 watt standard charger with the USB-C cable manual and warranty certificates and a little ejector tool additionally you could get a dedicated plastic case and an external keyboard which matching the size of the Redmi Pad the design of the pad incorporates a precision aluminum unibody enclosure that is strong light and durable and the very first thing you'll notice when you lift the pad from its box is the slim body with only seven millimeters of thickness it features a rectangular design with straight edges and curved corners which not just look elegant but also efficiently packages the solid technology inside I'll talk about it in a minute the pad comes in three color versions: mint green moonlight silver and graphite gray - which is the model we're reviewing today at the top edge we can find the speaker grilles and the power on/off button the left edge has a discrete micro SD card slot two microphones and volume up and down buttons and the bottom edge has another two speaker grilles and the USB-C socket to plug the charger keyboard or external OTG devices such as hard disks the positioning of the four speakers at the top and bottom edges is ideal to generate surround Dolby Atmos sound however the sound is fire straight to the palm of your hands and not into the room at the back we got a primary 8 megapixels camera compartment it's just out so it might cause the tablet to rock when placed flat on a desk but it doesn't spoil the overall finish 10.61 inch display - please note it's not 10.6 - but it's 10.61 inch adopting a 5:3 aspect ratio and it looks very close to the one used in Apple iPads the display has a small bezel which is just enough to let you hold the pad comfortably in your hands without the risk of accidentally tapping the screen Xiaomi has taken steps to reduce the bezel to just about perfect size overall build quality is very high these days almost everyone prefers the narrower body both in terms of design and usability this might be a budget tablet but that certainly isn't given away by its design as I mentioned earlier Xiaomi has fitted a new 90 Hertz 10.61 inch IPS display with a resolution of 1200 by 2000 pixels and adopts 5:3 aspect ratio this is a very good quality IPS panel which makes for excellent life-like colors and very good viewed angles and is also very fluid and the Redmi Pad offers sharp images and clear text blacks are pretty good too with a high contrast ratio and a maximum brightness of 400 nits that's really not bad for a budget tablet and should make the screen much easier to read in a sunlight it's not often you'll pick a tablet to use it as a camera the camera app is basic but it takes really good images and you do get HDR on variety of filters this is an example of the photo taken by the 8 megapixel back camera for comparison the same photos taken by the latest iPad - can you tell the difference? let's capture some video the Pad records videos in 4k and 30 FPS however there's no image stabilization so the captured material might be a bit wobbly for comparison the same video captured by the latest iPad Air around the front where you're more likely to take advantage of the camera for video chat is an 8 megapixel selfie camera which allows to record the videos and make video calls in 4K resolution you can also use this to unlock the tablet using face recognition the Redmi Pad is fitted with Mediatek Helio G99 processor built on the highly efficient TSMC 6 nanometers Helio G99 features an octa-core CPU with two high performance ARM cortex-A76 processor cores clocking up to 2.2 gigahertz and highly capable ARM Mali G57-class GPU the processor is comparable to Snapdragon 4Gen1 and Mediatek Dimensity 700 and its 6 nanometers class enables it to be exceptionally power efficient the pad comes in three variants: 3GB of RAM and 60GB of storage - this is the most budgety version which is the one I'm testing today then there's a 4GB RAM version with 128GB of storage and the highest spec version with 6GB of RAM plus 128GB of internal storage I would strongly recommend to get the highest spec version and I'll tell you why although this is the lowest spec version of Redmi Pad with only 3GB of RAM in a real-world use I found no issues with lags when opening the apps and navigating through the menus it's actually very fluid storage is fine even if you opt in for the 64GB especially now when you can add a microSD card up to 1TB in capacity so with that being said let's check out how the Redmi Pad performs when playing the most power demanding games currently available and before we carry on make sure you're subscribed I tried one of the best racing games - Asphalt 9 Legends the image quality isn't the highest however the fluidity of the game is fine no dropped FPS even in a busy moments right, next in a queue one of my favorite shooters - Call of Duty Mobile I couldn't change the image quality as in the settings there's a \"low\" for graphics as default settings however the game works without any significant frame drops it's a bit disappointing because to be honest I was expecting slightly better visual performance from that new Helio G99 that everyone's raving about these days the next in line in this is probably most processing power hungry game of all times - Genshin Impact I guess the graphic quality and the FPS are the lowest by default but even now we can notice significant drops in frames the game gets choppy if there's a loads going on and that's why the extra RAM would be very useful here no point to play Genshin or other high-end games if you have only 3GB of RAM on board so again if you're thinking about getting the Redmi Pad consider the highest spec model and then you won't be disappointed and what's interesting this game is being pre-installed on the tab which implies it's supposed to run great on this machine but it's just average... and this is exactly what I've just mentioned - 6GB of RAM is the best balance between the cost and performance users who want to play the power hungry games or have many different apps opened at the same time and want to switch between them quickly or want to use some video editing apps should definitely go for six gigabytes RAM version in the antutu benchmark test the lowest version of Xiaomi Redmi Pad with 3GB of RAM gets a score of 354.841 points which is comparable with the iPhone XR and that's about three times less than the latest iPad Air but let's keep in mind it's a budget device inside this Redmi Pad we got 8000mAh battery and according to Xiaomi the battery life remains up to 12 hours video playback during my use I have managed to record around 10 hours of YouTube streaming which is close to promised all-day-life score as an illustrative example I stream YouTube on iPad Air just to see how the Redmi's battery holds up against nearly four times more expensive device as much as I like my iPad its battery was the only disappointment for me it died after around 4 hours of streaming and Redmi Pad is still alive the Redmi's battery saving modes significantly contributes to the good performance of the battery right it died after approximately 10 hours and the latest iPad Air's battery died after 4 hours in terms of connectivity the Redmi comes with dual bands 2.4GHz plus 5GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.3 on board and there's no support for a mobile networks no supports for NFC for contactless payments but I'm more surprised by the lack of GPS it's obviously possible to use apps such as Google Maps but it uses Wi-Fi scanning to pinpoint your location the Pad runs on MIUI 13 based on Android 12 it has loads of extras you won't find in stock Androids such as dual apps and split or second screen but the MIUI is very easy to navigate and is well optimized for the landscape use there's a dark mode, split screen floating windows, game turbo and also there's a virtual expansion of the RAM space it can reserve additional 1GB of storage to be used as a virtual extension of RAM which is very useful the Redmi Pad is an ideal budget tablet for general use with an attractive design and some competitive hardware on board it's ideal for streaming YouTube or Netflix or for consuming any visual content thanks to its 90Hz high quality display and Dolby Atmos sound system if you would need an inexpensive device for casual gaming I would strongly recommend the highest version with the 6GB of RAM which also offers 128GB of storage and that's enough to install several games you can pick up the Xiaomi Redmi Pad on Amazon as well as on AliExpress and there are affiliate links in this video description okay guys that's it for today I hope you enjoyed that video and found it pretty informative and useful if you're new to the channel make sure you're subscribed so you won't miss when the next video comes outHi everyone welcome you to another unboxing video so today what we have taken for unboxing is [music] redmp3 sd display it has i care display and 6 am spun to spun 680 processor in it and it has written battery life of 8 hours So it has a battery of 8000 A, it is not written in it that it has long lasting battery, it is written that it has speaker power, it has got certification for its speaker and there is nothing in it with a favorite, it is written on this side that it has 4GB RAM, 128GB RAM, so its When I checked it also comes in other variants like 4gb ram 64gb ram and one comes 4gb ram 128gb which is this and one also comes in 256gb and it comes in three color variants one is mint blue mint green And one is lavender lavender and one is dark gray or sorry gray, it has some color, it comes in three colors, grey, mint green and lavender or purple, whatever you say, let's open it now, so before taking it, I will try it a little. I did research for all the tabs around this, so I went first, A series comes, ultra series comes, all those come more, so take the other series, its a9 series, a8 series, a9 plus, I saw in one, the price was around this. It was around Rs 200-220 so I felt the difference between it and it was that its refresh rate was 90 Hz, it had a reference rate of 60 Hz and some had 4GB 64GB. In this price range, I liked everything about it and a The thing is good that I will get to know if I open it now, otherwise I found my earphone jack in it which was not found in the other ones, so that is also a point. Let us unbox it now and let us see what is inside it. So, what I was saying is that what we checked is that it offers pen plus back cover for Rs. 199, so I had to take it because the brand doesn't have much to offer and usage also matters. I don't have such a fast usage, I have a laptop, so mostly I use it just for travelling, if I have to use it only for watching movies etc, then the same thing is written in it, Stylish Metal Univ Design 6M Snap. Dragon processor 90 Hz refresh rate 8000 mAh large battery, so it comes with a cover, after that your tub has come, a thin cover has been put on it and it is of bag type, now keep it on the side, the accessories that are with it are the first. Let's see what is there in it, there is a small box inside it in which you get a charger which is very useful and it has Type C, Made in China Type C Pinay, there are two boxes for charging, this was another box in which Some books give books to read, there is a manual about it, no one reads what is inside it, that's fine and there comes a warranty card, which is your bill itself, the main warranty card, after this I don't . Think and something, yes, there is a pin in it, maybe the memory card is expandable in it, I had forgotten that the memory card is expandable till One TV, that is one thing good in it, if you want, you can put your memory card in it. For expandable storage, this is a Its slot has arrived, let's leave it here for now, there is something inside it, there is nothing inside it, there is nothing inside it, no, it just sounds, that's all we get inside it, so let's open it, which is the main thing, we have given a cover . When we got our tab, its look and feel is like this, that is, it looks good, it is good to hold in the hand, let's turn it on, it has a speaker here, we will check it, how much sound does it produce, and it has a C type charger. And just like I said that earphone jack is given in it and there are two speakers on this side too, so I hope that its sound will be very good. There is a PIM tray here, not a seam tray, this is its tray, I think it is my memory card tray. And this side is completely flat, there is nothing in it, this one is on button, I just pressed it, so this booting is happening now, how much time does it take for booting, let's also see, it has not happened yet, what time does it take, this is the first boot. So that's why it takes time, so I will not edit it at all, I will put it in full text, so do people know how much time it takes to tink it, aye yawai pad 14, so above this, this is above this, aye yawai ka yawai, above this, so above this, chick. If the language is English, then it is fine. Next let's choose the region. So right now I am in Germany, so I can go to the drop down in it, otherwise you can also go to the search and see. Germany is already setup, so this is how it is for setup, so you can see it. You can view horizontally as well as vertically It is a normal thing vertically, so right now I just want to do a basic test in it, one is its video and one is its sound, we have to see both of them, so right now I don't want to do it, okay, so let's play some 4K videos in this, in which my My internet should also run that fast, it doesn't work in Germany, I searched for this video, now let's play a 4K video, its sound makes me feel happy while watching it , I get high in the language [music] I must be hearing the sound, its full sound I do [music], it has two speakers on this side, sound is coming from two on this side, so I liked the sound very much, the picture quality is also very good, it is very correct [music] , so now this is the sound. And the video seemed very correct to me, it is 144 which is pad six, its better resolution will obviously be visible because it is 144, its refresh rate is 90, so 90 Hz means I felt it very correct, meaning the laptop has been placed very sexy from the top, after that more. One thing is that Pad 6 is there, let's close it, first it was Pad 6 which is there, so I thought that I will just put it in it, it will be good for normal travel etc., so this was its review, now I use it, if there is anything above it. If you have any questions, please comment. If I can tell you something then there is no need to dive too deep.Hello everyone, you are on the polz net channel My name is Sani and here there are only detailed reviews and long streams and today, against all odds, in spite of everything, I will tell you about this tablet. I bought it on aliexpress during a sale, they sent it to me quite quickly, it’s redmi Pad SE from we had a redmi pad last year, I reviewed it by the way, it’s quite popular. What’s surprising Why is it surprising because it’s a super mega economy class on the one hand on the other hand It has everything you need, it’s possible to connect headphones directly via the MIC, not only Bluetooth Of course there is wi-fi Of course, it is possible to expand the internal memory via a memory card, there are quite good speakers here, not the worst pixel density of 90 Hz of the screen, and finally, it seems like finally a Qualcom BCC processor because I remind you that in the previous version we had a helio g99 But as they say, we are not in a hurry to buy Why Because several things in the world are now selling poorly. The first is tablets. The second is selling poorly is laptops. And third, you can google yourself that solid-state drives are selling very poorly. That is, if you are going to purchase such a device, it seems that you have a choice small but in fact just space Why Because they are not particularly moving forward like flagships, for example, with smartphones in terms of cameras or processors, they are, in a sense, marking time, trying to make for us a more convenient product, comfortable for use with a longer battery life And Of course, at a lower cost, how well Xiaomi Redmi did with this device you will now find out in the video. Of course, with useless examples of the camera’s operation, let’s move on to unpacking. Packaging weighs 837 g. This tablet comes in a white box with a picture of the tablet itself; model name and brief characteristics. Of course, The box came intact, as did the tablet itself, everything was packaged reliably and perfectly, in the kit we have documentation cable with USB type-c power supply for a very modest 10 W and the redmi tablet itself decided to save on everything, together with Xiaomi the slot in the tablet is designed for a memory card of up to 1 TV Although it also asks for a physical SIM card, but there is no such option here, the dimensions of the device are 255 by 167 by 8 mm and the tablet weighs 468 g, we fly further, draws in the sea, we read the description Which ones are constantly relevant now, these are 5 mi Benda in the seventh episode, they are given away for likes, subscriptions and comments to any video monthly Subscribe with a bell Don't forget to subscribe to the Telegram channel for mutual aid discounts and my personal Telegram channel. The links in the description to the word on Ali are now on sale and there are a lot of interesting things there and Yes, I even bought pixels there for the eighth and 8 Pro, there are also a lot of useful things there small things for 180 rubles in general there is where to rummage today what will happen tomorrow come into the cart you will see everyone Thank you very much in advance for watching let's fly to buy redmi Pat SE you can get it in grey, mint green and lavender Olya colors the edges of the tablet are straight the block with the camera on the back looks good the body matte And it is made of aluminum alloy, the design of the device is attractive, the build quality is good, the body, by the way, is not particularly easily soiled in the hands; it is comfortable to print in a vertical position as well as in a horizontal position; it is quite convenient on the case; the power button is located on the body; volume control rocker; USB type-c OTG connector version 2.0 microphones four stereo speakers Dolby atmos and sound preset even a custom equalizer on board but there is no vibration here the sound quality is good in my opinion it lacks volume and depth otherwise such sound for this price tag is enough for everyday use of a 3.5 mm midc on board for what a separate plus But for the way it was made, in my opinion, in all the reviews it is clear that some kind of collective farm approach is not only asymmetrical, but also the feeling that it was cut out with a crooked drill. But the only thing is that there is no support for a branded keyboard cover and stylus support can be seen here and there in advertising but I haven’t seen the official statement, let’s fly further redmi Pat SE is equipped with an 11-inch IPS display, it is slightly larger compared to the previous model with a resolution of 19920 by 12200 pixels. But in terms of pixel density here, the frames of the screen are downscale; standard viewing angles are within normal limits for such a matrix Body screen ratio 84.4 pro available support for 16.7 million colors contrast ratio of 15,500 to one plus the screen has tuv Rain Land certification blue light protection screen certification without anything and everything on board there is a reading mode version 3.0 pixel density here has become worse than in the previous version of redmi 207 ppi brightness 400 nits when light hits the screen directly, the brightness may or may not be enough. It all depends on you. And of course, I wouldn’t recommend using it on the beach; it won’t be enough brightness at home; auto-brightness works great and quickly adjusts to changing lighting; screen refresh rate is maximum 90 Hz with adaptive syn technology, while I want to say that it drops to more than 4 Hz and, in principle, I’m not surprised, the processor does not pass the touch sampling frequency test. You can see on the screen there is a multi-touch for 10 touches, it responds quite quickly and unlocks the screen well You can use standard unlocking methods as well as facial recognition, unfortunately there is no fingerprint scanner, facial recognition works well, both in the vertical position of the tablet and in the horizontal position, even at a slight angle, you can enter biometric data for up to two persons, for which special thanks, we fly further, the processor is installed qualcomm snapdragon 680 C tech process 6 nmt with eight cores and a maximum frequency of 2.4 GHz As they say One step forward two back Yes redmi of the previous version even if it was helio but the processor was more vigorous graphics processor adrana 610 interface Mi iPad in version fourteen based on Android version thirteen Of course all this will be updated the system is available in Russian since it is Global RAM is available in a choice of 46 and 8 GB but of course I would not recommend considering 4re at all because with six it slows down very quickly the internal memory emmc version 5.1 of 128 GB for which is definitely a huge minus , but I remind you that it is possible to expand the internal memory by inserting a microSD And this is good. The tablet uses wi-fi of the fifth series, old and old Bluetooth version 5.0, video calling via messenger is quite convenient, the microphones work well, the sound is clear, NFC Of course, it is not supported GPS is missing pcmark I have it failed But to put it simply , in one hour playing games with simultaneous streaming on Twitch, only 20% of the charge is consumed and about 6% is spent when watching YouTube for an hour on Wi-Fi. Of course, it also supports wired charging with a power of up to 18 W, it will charge everything equals about 2 hours, let's move on to the tests throttling test it passes poorly geekbench fails also not good you can see the numbers for yourself 3D Mark knocked out the minimum number of points the main thing was knocked out Because some devices can’t even pass it how much did it knock out Tutu these are tears less than x hundreds of thousands of points this is 20% worse than the processor in its previous version. By the way, the 3D brand also had fairly stable work. In the rear part, we placed a unit with an 8-megapixel main sensor with an aperture of 2.0, that’s all the gags; video recording is available in a maximum resolution of 1080p 30 FPS front camera 5 megapixels with an aperture of 2.2, the maximum resolution for shooting video here is 1080p 30 FPS modes for photo and video shooting, a minimum number, but the standard on-board cameras in this tablet are not a strong point for video calls, in principle, well, 1080 30p Let's be objective, no one you won’t be able to drag a tablet up a mountain with you, and of this size, and with such a camera, but you just have a unique opportunity to look at the person who dragged it, and that’s how the camera will work with the X5 X5; this magnification can be paused; you can stop and in general, if you shoot the whole thing with one hand, then the shooting I don’t know what it’s good for, but it might be good for something, in any case, you see an example of how it works and the front camera is 108p 30 FPS, the same conditions as for the main camera of the place in which you definitely won’t go with this tablet and you definitely won’t shoot with it, but suddenly you forgot your phone, your child stuffed this thing into a backpack, you can shoot with it Just like that and A little more video, literally 15 seconds, I don’t know how people make video microphones how they work it out But on Twitch they worked it out very poorly, quietly and night shooting with a front camera like this approximately you will be able to film yourself with a front camera At night, of course it slows down I hope the microphones work with the ball you can see for yourself how things are here Where are the night videos, there was lightning that you definitely won’t see you see how the camera breathes and everything slows down I hope you can hear my voice Well that's basically everything you needed to know about night photography, which of course can't be good for that kind of money with such a thing, I rarely suffer, example of working in an elevator. And the camera of the RI tablet, look, the camera isn't breathing, the autofocus isn't breathing. I mean, well, now again cons no vibration motor no support for a proprietary keyboard bad type of internal memory you can play but it will be a pain and this is two steps back relative to their previous model from the same redmi I want to note the price you can see at the link in the description of the video Don’t forget to subscribe to the Telegram channel for mutual assistance discounts and my personal Telegram channel Follow the links in the description to everyone Thank you so much for watching and subscribe to the channel with a bell double thank you I want to use the camera of the device itself in a non-standard way because it’s really dark And again Sony fx3 through the Rod microphone that I’m wearing put on so this is what I would like to tell you Step forward two back, that is, they made a processor, they crammed in a weaker internal memory, poor pixel density here below, the screen is 400, in principle, there is enough brightness But who is this for, what is this device for, so that they just have an updated fleet of economy -class or they were just given a lko Movses litter 680 they had nowhere to stuff them But in this collective farm drill they probably drank a minijack in the case for it you just need to swear, okay, our type sish neck is not in the center But this does it Well, what a disgrace -I repeat about the fleet of tablets, it’s the same thing as with smart watches on them. By the way, the top 10 was already on the channel and I try to do reviews for almost all smart watches in the same way as for most tablets. We have a sea of ​​tablets from Samsung But there are very few of them cheap, but on the other hand, we have Norov’s Huawei VSS and tablets from the Huawei Air Force, which do not have Google services. Of course, I don’t recommend them if you take realme pads, then everything is obscurantist there, but there is a 50% lower price tag if you take the old one redmi then it is more preferable because it has a more powerful processor for whom and for what is this the case if you purchased in principle in dollar equivalent a very good buy and to say that something there has vibration something there has besides this I don’t know any better camera Well, friends, we are not just paying for the brand here, we are overpaying here, first of all, for the system, system and plus software Yes, it stutters Yes, 90 Hz is not everywhere here and they will most likely slow down facts, but does this device have the right to life, yes, although I If I were in their place, I definitely wouldn’t release something like this. I can definitely recommend it. If you bought it, then yes. If you didn’t buy it, then a thousand times. Think about it because everything is quite simple in tablets, there is a very large selection, insanely large, even among some flagship devices. If you open it, we will shoot ourselves As they say in the foot of Avito, you will see just an insane number of tablets that are also sold, by the way, as smart watches and there are also plenty to choose from. Why Because this, like laptops, is an absolutely unpopular thing. You must remember this, where are your scripts? I have this thing with a keyboard that costs as much as these two tablets. But it’s exactly there. That is, I only use it on the road to mount a light one. And although it can be heavy, it can be taken out and said that MA are those who need it, like styluses in smartphones that only s23 Hooray, they will go and choose all the information that I could give you on it I gave it to me as a device as a stand-alone without a choice Yes, as a device that has an alternative, definitely not, first of all because of the process, well, you laugh 300,000 points Van Tutu is not you understand my emotions I hope that if you have reached this point then you are interested in my opinion in addition to, in principle, all tests, subscribe to the channel with a bell of goodness and good luck to you, dear friendsHonestly, this tablet is very nice. Hello everyone, it's Jo. Today I'm going to tell you what I thought of the Redmi Pad SE, the new one entry-level tablet from Xiaomi. With the tablet, Xiaomi provided us with a USB type C cable, a 5V 2A selector charger and a needle for the SD card slot. When you pick up the tablet, it's hard to imagine being on equipment entry level and yet, it is the case. The unibody case is made of aluminum, the edges are flat and the finishes are good, even very good. There is honestly not much to complain about this Redmi Pad SE in that regard . And I would add that it is even as qualitative as tablets sold 2 to 3 times more expensive. Yes, yes, really. Especially since it is practical to transport and even to use with its low weight of 478 grams . Its dimensions are 255.53 mm by 167.08 for 7.36 mm thickness. On the front, we have rather thin and homogeneous borders with a screen that occupies 84.4% of the surface. It's an 11-inch Full HD+ panel, with a definition of 1920 by 1200 pixels, so 207 pixels per inch. It's not a very high definition for a screen of this size, we agree, but it's still perfectly OK to read text or watch content. In good conditions, the image quality is good, the colors are beautiful and well contrasted, even if the blacks are not as deep as you could have with an AMOLED screen. But the same can be said of all IPS screens compared to AMOLED. We can also precisely adjust the colors, the contrasts. I noticed two defects on the screen. Firstly, there is the high reflectance which makes the screen difficult to read when viewed from a wide angle. And there is too little brightness to use the tablet in direct sunlight. Outdoors, yes, but not in direct sunlight. The screen refresh rate is 90 Hz. And I find a good compromise between 60 Hz less fluid and the more demanding 120 Hz. So we're in between. And it therefore provides appreciable fluidity while having less impact than 120 Hz on autonomy . Unfortunately, the feeling of fluidity is still marred at times by some jerks. But it's not due to the screen itself. There are no problems on the screen side. It's because of the processor. So we are not using a super efficient processor. It's a Snapdragon 680. It's a very decent processor, no problem. We already found it on entry-level phones in 2022. But even if its performance is honorable, it's not war lightning. And so we can see some slowdowns from time to time. This is coupled with 4, 6 or 8 GB of LPDDR4X Ram memory and 128 GB of eMMC 5.1 storage . So we have no choice about storage. It's 128, if you want 256, you'll look elsewhere. No, there is still a trick. This means that you can insert an SD card to increase the storage to 1 Tera. And I appreciate that. So let me be clear, this configuration is very good for this price range. And it will allow you to do basic tasks very correctly. It's not at all a hassle to use. If you don't have big needs for a tablet for demanding applications or something, it will do the job. affair. If you like the basic interface of Xiaomi smartphones, which is called MIUI, you will be on conquered territory with the interface of this tablet which is called MIUI Pad. You will easily find your bearings, it is similar in many aspects. And there is an aspect that I really appreciate on MIUI and which is also present on MIUI Pad. This is the ability to modify transitions between pages on the Android desktop. And whether you prefer a slide, fade, circular, page, waterfall, rotated or even cube effect, you will find your happiness without any problem. Ah yes, another thing, multitasking is also very practical. By holding down an application, you can activate floating window mode and therefore move this application wherever you want on the tablet screen. But we can also separate the display into two applications and resize the space we will allocate to them . We can also find in multitasking the application associations that we have made to return to this layout in one click. And they are even present in the lower shortcut bar. So you will be able to see, instead of having an application icon, you will have an icon coupled in two with two applications. And it's frankly a significant time saver. Surprisingly, I didn't expect much from the sound on a tablet for less than €200 and I I quite enjoyed it. The 4 speakers and Dolby Atmos compatibility offer a fairly impressive result for video playback in relation to the price of the device. Honestly, watching movies and series on this Redmi Pad SE without headphones, it's very pleasant and immersive. It pleasantly surprised me, I honestly wasn't expecting that much. The sound part, often technological devices, is not the most worked part unfortunately. If you are interested in this Redmi Pad SE, remember to go through the links in the description of the video. I repeat it every time, but it doesn't cost you more. And I receive a small commission which allows me to keep the channel alive. The cheapest model, i.e. the 4 GB of RAM, 128 GB storage, can be found from €190 on online sales sites. Unsurprisingly, the photo and video quality of this Redmi Pad SE is excellent. No, I'm kidding, not just tablets do not generally shine in this area, unlike smartphones, but what's more here, we are on an entry-level tablet. The rear camera is 8 megapixels with f2.0 aperture. We can take decent photos in very good lighting conditions, but that's it. It could ultimately help to make a video in 1080p 30 frames per second maximum, but we be okay only if you don't have anything else with you, if you don't have your smartphone or something, and you really want to show someone something, but no more. On the front, we have a 5 megapixel camera module with f2.2 aperture. It's not good quality either, but it will be enough for making video calls. The Redmi Pad SE is not a gaming tablet. There you go, that's all said, let's move on. No, the real question is, even if it's not a tablet made for gaming, does it still allow you to play games? And gourmet games. Yes and yes, but with concessions of course, don't mess around. If you want to play a game of Genshin Impact or PUBG, nothing will stop you, you do what you want, you download it from the Play Store and play. Of course, there will be concessions at the graphics level and at the level of some slight slowdowns, but for example on PUBG, I had smooth graphics mode with high frame rate and it was running well, very correctly. It's not an exceptional experience, it's not designed for, but we have a processor not very greedy which does not heat too much, not excessively. I want to say, it's okay. The 10 -watt charger can fully recharge the 8000 mAh battery in two hours. It's a bit long, it's even quite long, but for a tablet, we're generally less eye-catching than a smartphone. We generally don't need to take it before going out, it's more of a use for the House. On the other hand, the autonomy is good. We will be able to watch videos, films, series for 13-14 hours maximum. That's very correct. There is plenty to do. The Battery Life test on PCMark gave me a score of 20:46, screen time on in mixed use, web browsing, photo and video editing, word processing, data manipulation, etc. Which means that in normal use, with periods where you will not touch your tablet, you can go way beyond that. On this tablet, we unfortunately do not have a physical keyboard connector. So if you need to use a keyboard, you will need to buy a Bluetooth one. It's a shame, but at the same time, it's normal. On an entry-level tablet, there aren't that many people who use a keyboard . And that helps limit costs and keep the price low. In the end, this Redmi Pad SE fulfills its contract perfectly, and even more. If you need a tablet to read your emails, to surf the Internet, wander around on social networks, because yes, we wander around on social networks, like we surf the Internet, or even watch films and series legally, while having a small budget, you can go there without problem. There is no real flaw that seemed prohibitive to me, apart from the photo and video quality , but it is on a large part of the shelves. Even much more expensive tablets aren't great in this area. In the end, you understand, I appreciated this Redmi Pad SE. But the question is you, what do you think? And do you need a tablet? If you want to support me, don't forget the big thumbs up. If you have time to leave a little comment, it's good for SEO. And if you liked the video, don't hesitate to share it with as many people as possible. It was Olympics for Kulture ChroniK.

      "- I'm so excited at what Samsung did this year. After they didn't release an FE version of the Tab S8, they released not one but two FE versions of the newer Tab S9 lineup. So let's talk about how they compare, the interesting differences in battery life, whether either one of these is actually worth getting. And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. So overall, these are two very similar tablets, and one of the most important differences is size. The Tab S9 FE is smaller with a 10.9 inch display, the FE+ comes with a larger 12.4 inch display, so naturally, it's larger and heavier, but it's not any thicker. The two tablets have a similar design with a full aluminum frame and back, and I love that Samsung was able to bring IP68 rating down to the FE version, giving both tablets protection from water and dust. Now this is great if you take your tablet with you to work or when you travel, but it's also a super nice feature if you're using it around the house and you have a dog that likes to throw toys up in the air and also has a super aggressive tail. Now both tablets offer face recognition for biometric authentication, and a more secure fingerprint sensor, which is integrated into the power button. Now the fingerprint sensor on the FE models has worked great for me, but it's just a little less convenient than the under-display sensor on the flagship models. Both tablets also have a microSD card slot, so we can upgrade the internal storage by up to one terabyte, and we can use that storage for photos, for videos, for files, and for most apps. Now continuing to look around the edges, we're getting two AKG-tuned speakers on both tablets. And while the flagship models come with four speakers and sound fuller, the FE models are not too shabby if you're someone who actually uses the speakers on their tablet. Now going back to the display, both tablets have an IPS LCD display, which offers a 90 hertz adaptive refresh rate. The FE model has a low resolution but a slightly higher pixel density. And realistically, you aren't really going to notice that difference in terms of sharpness. Now I like the higher resolution and the larger display on the FE+ because I'm able to see more without having to scroll and it's better for multitasking. But of course, you're giving up on portability and there are also some implications in terms of gaming, which we'll talk about later on. Now both tablets have an aspect ratio of 16:10, so they're excellent for watching content. And in terms of image quality, both are very good for LCD displays. And if you're looking for an even better display, you can check out the Tab S8+ or the Tab S8 Ultra with their dynamic AMOLED display, or jump to the current flagship Tab S9 models with their dynamic AMOLED 2X displays. Now when it comes to gaming, it's important to consider the fact that these are not flagship models. So part of what you're giving up is performance. I was able to play my usual games like \"Genshin,\" \"Asphalt,\" \"PUBG,\" and then, of course, some less demanding games, but there's an obvious difference in both processing power and GPU performance when compared with the flagship models, and it did have an impact on more resource-intensive games. The two FE models performed about the same, and we'll quickly go over benchmarks in the Performance section, but there's no question that Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip in the flagship models is more capable than the Exynos 1380 in the FE versions. Using \"PUBG\" as an example, with the FE model, I was limited to high frame rate whether Graphics were set to Smooth, Balanced, or HD, and that was as good as it got. So I definitely couldn't get to 90 FPS. With the flagship models, gameplay was smoother and more responsive, and I could play with Graphics set to Smooth and Frame Rate set to 90 FPS. I could also set Graphics anywhere from Balanced to HDR and Frame Rate to Extreme, or ultra HD for Graphics and Ultra for Frame Rate. While playing \"Genshin Impact,\" I had a very similar experience where it was playable on the FE models, but it was much more fluid and less laggy on the flagship models. Again, because of the more capable processor and the additional RAM. Now the FE+ model does come with either two or four more gigs of RAM than the FE model. Depending on which storage option we're comparing in, we'll cover that in the Configuration section. Either way, if more demanding games are a priority for you, then keep in mind that we know game developers are always going to push to CPU and GPU, and games are going to evolve and start to demand more and more resources. When I look to keep a device for at least four to five years, I'm always going to opt for the tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance than I need right now. And that way, I know that it'll continue to perform better in the future. Something else to consider is the size of the display. The FE+ is bigger, so it's easier to see someone sniping at you from a distance, but the FE model is smaller and lighter so it's more comfortable to hold and play for longer periods of time. If you wanna stream and play Xbox games with the Xbox Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox controller with both tablets and have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection. I would give the edge to the FE+ model because of the larger display. And both tablets started with 120 gigabytes of storage and have a 256 gigabyte model. So there's no advantage in terms of space for games. And remember that you can use the microSD for additional inexpensive storage, which is a great deal. And speaking of that, if you're looking for great deals on new tech, check out today's sponsor, Best Buy, where you can get a 512 gigabyte Samsung Pro Plus microSD card for 40 bucks.

Now back to the tablets, another factor to consider is the ability to expand the functionality of each tablet by adding a keyboard case and a stylus. Now both tablets are compatible with two versions of the Book Cover Keyboard from Samsung. In that context, I prefer the FE+ because it's larger and more comfortable to type on. And of course, you can always use an external Bluetooth keyboard instead. Now both tablets also come with a free S Pen, which can be stored on the side or on the back of the tablet, but these are not Bluetooth-enabled S Pens like the ones that come with the flagship models. In terms of the actual writing experience, it's going to be the same with both tablets. And the only practical difference here is the larger canvas on the FE+ model. Looking at the camera systems, both have an eight megapixel rear-facing camera and a 12 megapixel selfie camera. So here's a quick sample. Here's a camera and microphone test of the Tab S9 FE and the Tab S9 FE+. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect from both tablets. We talked about performance in the Gaming section, so let's quickly look at the single and multi-core performance of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and the Exynos 138 so you can see the differences between the FE and the flagship models. We also see a significant difference in GPU performance, which helps explain some of the differences we saw when gaming. This is not to say that the FE models are not a good value. If you're surfing the web, watching video, or going on social media, you'll definitely be able to use these tablets. And even for like gaming or for and other typical tasks, these will work great. Of course, for more demanding things like photo and video editing or for more demanding games, the flagship models are more capable, but I always encourage you to keep in mind what you plan on doing and not buy products based on somebody else's needs. Both tablets run the latest Android and One UI, so you're getting all the latest features like three tiled apps, pop-up windows, and then of course DeX, which is awesome. So essentially, it reboots the tablet and gives you an operating system that is very similar to a desktop OS. You're getting a task bar, a desktop with icons, multiple windows, you can snap windows, and you can use a keyboard case to transform your tablet to more of a laptop replacement. You can also connect an external keyboard and mouse for a better user experience, but you can't connect an external display and run a dual display setup with either the FE or the FE+. That's only available on the flagship models. You can, however, use both of these tablets as an additional display for your laptop or desktop with Samsung's Second Screen. This is a super handy feature when you travel. As far as OS and security updates, Samsung promises four years of OS updates and five years of security updates, which I think is great. In terms of battery life, the FE model has a smaller 8,000 milliamp per hour battery versus 10,090 on the FE+, and I was super curious to know how that would play out considering the differences in the display sizes. In my test, I found that the larger battery on the FE+ lasts longer even though it has to power the bigger display. And if you want more information, check out this detailed battery drain test of the entire Tab S9 lineup. Now both tablets offer 45 watt fast charging, but neither ships with an adapter, so that's something that you're gonna need to purchase separately. Now when we look at configuration options, both start out with 120 gigabytes of internal storage. The Tab S9 FE comes with six gigs of RAM, and the FE+ comes with eight gigs of RAM. If we upgrade to 256 gigabytes on both models, then we're getting eight gigs of RAM on the Tab S9 FE, and then 12 on the FE+. Now, I didn't notice a major difference in performance between the two of them, but of course, all other things being equal, having more RAM is better, especially if you're multitasking. So ultimately, the choice comes down to the smaller, less expensive, and more portable Tab S9 FE versus the FE+, which has a larger display, is better for multitasking, has more RAM, and better battery life. Now you should check out the battery drain test. Hopefully, this comparison was helpful. Click on my face to subscribe. You know what I always say, \"Buy it nice or buy it twice.\" Good luck and see you soon.Just like the iPad Pro, Samsung's flagship Tab S9 isn't made to appeal to the masses with its premium price, no doubt it offers a really good screen and performance, you sometimes just want a good looking tablet that doesn't feel too expensive but also serviceable at the same time, this is where the Galaxy Tab S9 FE fills in the gap, it looks pretty with a very similar aluminum build and design, and it costs almost half the price of the Tab S9 for the same amount of storage, which is really insane. So, after using it for two weeks, I have some thoughts and here's my review. Compared to the Tab S9, the Tab S9 FE has a slightly smaller screen at 10.9-inches and the bezels are slightly thicker, which gives it around the same dimensions and meanwhile, it is also thicker and heavier but despite that, I still find it very manageable even after holding for 30 minutes. The 10.9-inch display is a 1440p IPS LCD panel that refreshes at 90Hz, which is an improvement over what's offered on the Tab S7 FE previously, and though it lacks the color punch you get on an AMOLED display, it still looks decent for content consumption, not to mention the dual stereo speakers tuned by AKG with Dolby Atmos support, they sound pretty good and I daresay it is on par with the M1 iPad Air. The tablet features a fingerprint reader that's built into the power button, which I very much prefer to under display ones, it has pogo pins at the bottom to power the same book keyboard cover as the Tab S9, which I'm unfortunately not provided with the review unit, but it does come with a non-battery powered S Pen which can be attached magnetically to the top or back of the tablet, and speaking of the S Pen, I love how responsive and precise it is for scribbling on the tablet which is all thanks to the 90Hz display, if you intend to do art on it, Samsung does sell a Creator Edition S Pen that works with the tablet and has better precision. What really amazes me about the Tab S9 FE is the IP68 water and dust resistance that no other similar class tablets are offering at this time, though to be honest I don't see any real world use case for now and this will probably appeal to those who watches Netflix by the pool or in a bathtub, even the provided S Pen is IP68 water and dust resistant, which is really unexpected, but it’s a good thing that Samsung didn't leave out such durability on a cheaper device. The Tab S9 FE is powered by the Exynos 1380 SoC that also powers the Galaxy A54 5G, you also get 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of expandable storage, the former is a big step down from the Galaxy Tab S9 but unless you want to push the graphics quality in games, the Tab S9 FE actually performs pretty well as a productivity tablet, I encountered very minor stutters in switching apps and scrolling that I would say it is totally negligible, I'm very impressed with how optimized the UI is but as usual, most Android apps are still terrible at supporting tablet screens, Samsung DeX is available on the Tab S9 FE if you prefer a PC desktop like experience, but you can't expand the tablet's display to an external monitor because the USB-C port doesn't support display output and only has USB 2.0 transfer speeds, this isn't going to be a big deal for most people but I think it is something that Samsung should have included as it did on the older Tab S7 FE. The cameras on the tablet are very serviceable, you get a single 12MP camera on the back and an 8MP camera on the front, thought don't expect them to be as good as a phone camera but at least if you want to take some casual photos on it, they are really good for tablet standards, they both also support video recording at 4K 30fps, but I'm not sure why my unit's main camera is limited to just 1080p for whatever reasons, let me know in the comments if you faced the same thing on your unit. The Galaxy Tab S9 FE have no problems lasting up to two days if you are daily driving it as a productivity tablet, but I realized that standby times aren't that great as the battery can totally be depleted in 4 days if you aren't doing anything on it, although the saving grace here is Samsung's 45W fast charging, which can juice up a dead battery in 90 minutes and overall, I have no major complains about it. In my opinion, I think this is the most sensible FE product that Samsung has ever made, mainly because there isn't a lot of competition in the Android tablet market, and there is a clear price difference between the flagship Tab S9, the Tab S9 FE is obviously targeted at Apple's entry-level iPad and the M1 iPad Air, and I think it serves a great value proposition over these two when it comes to the hardware features, but definitely not when it comes to performance and the quality of apps you get on iPadOS, but even so, I think this is a better value tablet for media consumption and basic productivity due to its 16:10 aspect ratio that works really well.- When Samsung released the FE version of the Tab S9, I was so excited and I couldn't wait to do this comparison with the iPad 10. Both tablets are about the same size and the same price, but the choice wasn't as easy as I initially thought it would be. And by the way, I know prices around the world are very different, so if you're watching this from outside of the US, please let me know in the comment section where you're from and how much each of these tablets cost because obviously this is a really important factor and thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. So the first thing most people consider is the display. And in this case, the iPad 10 has a 10.9 inch liquid retina 60 Hertz display with the resolution of 1640 by 2360, a four by three aspect ratio and 264 pixels per inch. The Tab S9 FE also has a 10.9 inch IPS LCD display, but it's a 90 Hertz display, has a resolution of 1440 by 2304, an aspect ratio of 16 by 10 and then a lower pixel density of 249. Now in terms of image quality, both displays are sharp and crisp, and if I'm being critical, the iPad has better color accuracy and the Tab S9 FE is a bit warmer and has a slight greenish shift. I do like that it's a 90 Hertz display on the Tab S9 FE because things like animations and scrolling look smoother. Now, 60 Hertz has never really been a deal breaker for me. Right now I'm using three different phones, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Samsung S23 Ultra and the Pixel 8 Pro. So I'm used to 120 Hertz, but I think a higher refresh rate is a nice to have, but not critical for most tasks on mobile devices. There are exceptions, of course, like some games, but things got a little strange there. So I'll come back to that in the dedicated gaming section of this video. Now, in terms of aspect ratio, the Tab S9 FE is better suited for watching video because the 16 by 10 aspect ratio is closer to most content and the image is larger and has smaller black bars. Now with the iPad 10, we're getting a four by three aspect ratio, which is wider in portrait mode, and it's really nice when taking handwritten notes using the Apple Pencil. Now another important difference is that the Tab S9 FE has a fully laminated display. So the display, the touch layer and the cover glass are fused together into a single display assembly and the image looks like it's printed right on top of the glass. On the iPad 10, there is an air gap between the display and the combination of cover glass and touch layer. For a lot of things like watching movies, surfing the web or playing games, it's not really something that you're going to notice unless you really look for it, but when you're using the stylus, it does make a difference. So with the iPad 10, you'll be able to see separation between the tip of the Apple Pencil and the content that's being created, especially if you're looking at an angle. With the Tab S9 FE because the image looks like it's on top of the glass, it's going to look like the tip of the S Pen is touching the line or the content that you're creating, which of course is better. The one advantage of a non laminated display is that if the display gets damaged, most of the time it's just a cover glass so replacement is relatively inexpensive. With a fully laminated display, the entire display assembly has to be replaced even if you just scratch the cover glass. I'll also get to a few other important stylus differences in just a moment, but first I want to talk about gaming. So I play a lot of games on my tablets and I was really curious to see how these two would match up. So I was able to play my usual games like Genshin, Asphalt and PUBG and then of course less demanding games. But there was an obvious difference in both processing power and GPU performance, which did have an impact on more resource intensive games. I'll quickly show you benchmarks in the performance section, but this was one of those areas where I could clearly see the advantage of the iPad's A14 chip over the Exynos 1380. Now using PUBG as an example, gameplay was smoother and more responsive on the iPad, and I could play with balanced graphics and extreme frame rate versus balanced graphics and high frame rate on the Tab S9. And then of course, I could definitely not get to the 90 FPS that would take advantage of the faster refresh rate on the Samsung display. I had a similar experience with Genshin, which again performed better on the iPad 10, even though it has less RAM than a Tab S9 FE. Now looking ahead, we know that game developers are always looking to push the CPU and GPU and games are going to evolve and start to demand more and more resources. If I'm looking for a device to keep for the next four or five years or even more, I'm always going to opt for the tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance than what I need right now so it continues to perform well into the future. Now, if you wanna stream and play Xbox Games with the Xbox Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox controller with both tablets and have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection. But there's one area where the Tab S9 FE comes out ahead and that's storage. The iPad 10 starts out with 64 gigabytes of internal storage versus 128 gigs on the Tab S9 FE. To give you a sense of what that means, iPad OS currently takes up a little over 10 gigabytes of storage, system data takes up another 11 gigs, and PUBG uses a little over 20 gigs. So that's 41 out of 64 available gigabytes already used up with no other apps, files or photos. Now both tablets are also available in 256 gigabyte options. With the iPad, that's an additional 150 bucks, and with the Tab S9 FE, it's an extra 70 bucks. Now the Tab S9 FE also has a micro SD card slot, which you can use to expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. And you can use this storage for files, photos, videos, and for most apps. We'll talk more about the configuration options later on but for right now, I just wanna make sure that you have enough storage for all the apps and the games that you want to install. And that brings me to today's sponsor Best Buy and the Western Digital Storage Solutions for gamers. If you have a PlayStation 5, the Western Digital Black SN850 P NVME SSD is officially licensed.

And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this portion of the video. When we look at the overall design of these tablets, they're quite similar since Apple upgraded from the older iPad 9 design. Both tablets are machined aluminum, both have rounded corners and squared off edges, but the Tab S9 FE has slightly smaller bezels. We're getting a fingerprint sensor incorporated into the power button in both devices, on the iPad 10 it's on the short side, on the Tab S9 FE it's on the longer side, and both have been very accurate and responsive for me, but the iPad 10 has four speaker grills versus two on the Tab S9 FE, but both tablets only have two speakers, one on each side. In terms of audio quality, both are good but not as good as the higher end models. And the Tab S9 FE speakers are a tad louder and sound a bit brighter. One thing that I found when I'm gaming and holding the tablet in my hand is that on the iPad Air 4, I'm actually covering the speakers with my hand. So there are two other grills, so the sound can't come from there. But on the Tab S9 FE, the speakers are on the top if I'm holding in a landscape mode, so I'm not blocking them. Now personally, I'm okay either way because whenever I'm gaming, I'm wearing a headset, but I just wanted to mention it in case you don't. The Tab S9 FE also has an IP 68 rating, so we're getting protection from water and dust. Now, obviously this is important if you take your tablet with you and you travel or when you go outside, but even when you're just around the house, it's nice to have additional protection from accidental spills. Now, both tablets use a USB-C port for charging and connecting accessories, which brings me to the stylus and keyboard options. The iPad 10 is compatible with the first generation Apple Pencil, which costs $99. It pairs and charges using a cable, and it requires a USB to lightning adapter. The iPad is also compatible with the newer USB-C Apple Pencil, which charges and pairs with a wire but doesn't require an adapter. It costs $79. It doesn't offer pressure sensitivity, but it does magnetically attach to the side of the iPad. The Tab S9 FE comes with a free S Pen, which can be stored on the side or on the back of the tablet. It has a programmable button and it doesn't need to be charged in order to write or draw. Now, in terms of the actual writing experience, the Apple Pencil has a firm tip, so it's a little harsher when it hits the glass and it feels like you're writing on a single sheet of paper that's placed on a hard surface. The S Pen has a softer tip to it, so when it hits the glass, it gives a little, and it feels more like you're writing on a full pad of paper where the pages compress as you press down. Now, one isn't objectively better than the other for every single use and it's going to come down to which one feels better for you. So as always, I hope this description helps you make a choice. Now, as far as the camera systems, the iPad has a more capable rear facing camera in terms of resolution and frame rate, and both tablets have a 12 megapixel front facing camera. And here's a quick sample. Here's a camera and microphone test of the iPad 10 and the Tab S9 FE. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect from each tablet. Now, both tablets also have the front facing camera on the long edge, so you're always properly framed during video calls. Now, when we talked about gaming, I mentioned the performance of the iPad's A14 Bionic, and the Tab S9 FE's Exynos 1380. So let's quickly look at single and multi-core performance where we see the Apple chip pull ahead. We also see it's scored noticeably higher in GPU performance, which helps explain some of the differences we saw. Now, of course, these are just benchmark scores. So what about just typical real life use? Well, if you're surfing the web, watching video or going on social media, it doesn't really matter that much. You can easily do that with both tablets, but the iPad does feel snappier and more responsive, and I would expect it to continue to perform better for longer. Now, if you're doing something like a very heavy video editing, then again the iPad would be a better choice. When multitasking, the iPad can run two apps in split view, plus additional apps in a slide over window. The Tab S9 FE can run three tiled apps at the same time with more flexibility when it comes to how much real estate each app takes. It can also run multiple floating windows, which can be resized, and you can even change the transparency. Now, both tablets have a customizable dock, but the Tab S9 FE also has a super handy side panel for quick access. Now, both tablets can be used as additional displays for compatible desktops and laptops. Apple calls this feature sidecar and Samsung calls it second screen. These are great features and you should all use them, but if you're looking for more of a laptop replacement, the Tab S9 FE has DeX, which I love, but there is one limitation here. So if you're new to Samsung, DeX essentially reboots the tablet with an OS that looks very similar to what you get on a laptop. You've got a task bar where you can minimize and see active apps. You have an actual desktop with icons, and you can run multiple floating windows or snap windows to the side of the display. But unlike with the higher end Tab S9, S9+ and S9 Ultra, you can't connect an external monitor and run a dual display setup. The iPad 10 does let you mirror your display to an external display, but it doesn't stretch out to fill the entire monitor because the iPad 10 doesn't fully support stage manager, and it's not an extended display. So when it comes to being a laptop replacement, it's still a win for the Tab S9 FE, but not quite as good as what you get with the higher end models. Now, battery life is always interesting because it comes down to what you actually do. So comparing these devices when they're new, I'm looking at about 10 hours on the iPad 10, about 13 to 14 hours on a Tab S9 FE. Again, depending on what I was doing. Now, of course, these times are not of me gaming the entire time, and they include things like surfing the web, watching video, using social media apps, and working with productivity apps. Now, when you're looking at available apps, the Google Play Store, the Galaxy Store and the Apple App Store have a ton of options for pretty much everything that you need. In general, I'm going to give the edge to the iPad 10 because the apps seem to be better optimized for a tablet. But as I've said in recent videos, the gap continues to shrink. Several creative apps like Affinity Photo and Procreate are only available for the iPad, but it's great to see that there's an Android version of Luma Fusion. Now, both tablets run the latest available operating systems and Samsung promises four years of OS upgrades and five years of security updates. Now, Apple devices typically get longer support than that. So when I take into account the improved CPU and GPU performance, I'm going to give the iPad the edge in terms of longevity. I also want you to consider other products that you own which make up your ecosystem. Now, Samsung has made some really impressive improvements over the past few years, adding much needed integration between multiple devices, wireless file and text sharing, then additional cross device integrations. And even though the gap again continues to shrink, Apple's ecosystem is still more complete and more tightly integrated due to the fact that they have full control over the hardware and software on all of their devices. Now, when we look at configuration options and prices from the official stores, we already talked about the storage options, but both the 64 and 256 gigabyte models of the iPad 10 come with four gigabytes of RAM. with the Tab S9 FE, the 128 gigabyte model comes with six gigs of RAM and the 256 gigabyte model comes with eight. So here's how I look at this choice. The iPad is more powerful and will be more capable if you plan on keeping your device for many years and you like to play more demanding games at higher settings or performing other resource intensive tasks. It also offers better optimized apps, access to some creative specific apps and better longterm support. The Tab S9 FE is smaller and lighter. It offers additional protection with an IP 68 rating. It comes with a free S Pen, more storage, expandable storage, more capable multitasking, and better battery life. Now, you should see how the Tab S9 Ultra compares with the previous model. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.In August we got acquainted with the Galaxy Tab S9 series, with the S9 Ultra model showcasing the best Samsung has to offer in the premium Android tablet segment, and now it's time to meet the Galaxy Tab S9 FE - Fan Edition, the less extravagant alternative proposed to consumers with \"normal\" budgets and more moderate expectations. Being initially for a lower budget, Samsung has prepared the Galaxy Tab S9 FE in only two variants, FE and FE+, leaving the \"behemoth\" Tab S9 Ultra as a go-to solution for those who want everything to the max. We thus have the Tab S9 FE of 10.9 and the Tab S9 FE+ of 12.4 , both with an LCD screen and a mid-performance Exynos chipset. I remind you that starting with the Tab S9 series, Samsung offers OLED screens on all models in the range, including the basic Tab S9, ensuring that the premium tablet offering is differentiated in a way that leaves no room for interpretation. From a distance, you could be forgiven if you can't spot any difference between the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and the standard model. Both come in a brushed aluminum case, with almost identical weight and dimensions. The differences are so small that you can easily use the Galaxy Tab S9 accessories with the FE model. Samsung even retained the IP68 certification, a feature rarely found in tablets in this price range. Even if not entirely, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE still seems like a premium tablet. But since I don't look at things from a distance, let's see where the \"savings\" were made. One clue would be the lack of the S Pen zone on the FE, which is specifically marked on the back of the standard S9. Fortunately, this is only a design omission, as the S Pen included in the FE accessory package can be placed both on the back of the tablet and on the side frame. And as a result of choosing an LCD screen, the fingerprint sensor is now located on the side frame, integrated into the Power button. Far from being a compromise, the capacitive sensor is in an easily accessible location and gives good results, with fingerprint recognition being almost as fast as an optical solution integrated under the screen. Another indication of cost cuts would be the abandonment of the four-speaker configuration, with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE having only two speakers, designed for a stereo listening experience in landscape mode. So, if you're one of those who watch TikTok videos with the tablet in a vertical position, you'll have a less than great audio experience with the speakers in this top-bottom arrangement. On the other hand, the sound itself, \"tuned by AKG\", is of good fidelity and can rise to a reasonable volume without encountering distortion problems. A distinctive feature compared to the non-FE model, the LCD screen is well lit enough even for outdoor use, has vivid colors, and excellent image clarity. Yes, the LCD used doesn't have HDR10+ and can't reproduce the perfect black specific to OLED solutions, but it does more than a decent job. Even when placed side by side, you need to know what to look for to spot the differences between the S9 FE and the more expensive S9 model, released at the end of this summer. So, can the Galaxy Tab S9 FE be a credible alternative to Tab S9? Starting with a good first impression, the temptation would be to say yes. But as always, the truth is somewhere in between. With a price of $450 for the basic FE equipment, compared to the $800 for the Tab S9, it's hard to say no to a tablet like this. The assembly, finishes, and feeling are all right, and the screen, even if it's LCD, is not bad at all. However, you will fully feel the difference elsewhere: specifically, in the performance difference between the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor used by Tab S9, which is also found on the S23 Ultra, and Samsung's proprietary Exynos 1380 on the FE, also found on the Galaxy A54 for example. And the performance levels firmly position the Galaxy Tab S9 FE outside the circle of power users. Delivered with only 6GB of RAM in the basic configuration, the Tab S9 FE should at least be ordered in the 8GB/256GB memory version to enter that specification area for which Samsung optimizes the One UI firmware in the long term. And speaking of One UI, the current Samsung firmware based on Android 14 and One UI 6.0 seems a bit unfinished. Even if I didn't come across serious bugs, the fluidity of the interface and the tendency to \"hang\" at times contrast strongly with the One UI 5.1 experience on the Tab S9. I tend to believe that the weaker chipset is not the problem here, but rather the firmware part, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE needing some optimizations in this chapter. However, One UI features are essentially identical for both tablet series, with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE offering the same set of applications and optimizations for the S Pen, for example. Again, Samsung shows that the FE series is not for power users, restricting the use of DEX mode only to the tablet screen, without the possibility of connecting an external monitor. You can use both the Book Cover keyboard for emulating a mini-laptop or a keyboard and mouse set for PC, connected via Bluetooth. The Dex experience isn't bad, provided you limit yourself to at most two apps displayed simultaneously on the 10.9\" screen. Likewise, if you want to benefit from Air Actions support, you will have to buy the S Pen Pro accessory separately, the one included in the package not offering this option. But as a pleasant surprise, the gaming experience is decent, without stuttering or lag effects. However, it's good to know that in some demanding games, like PUBG, the detail level is automatically reduced to medium and should be kept that way to get a playable framerate. Considering the chipset used, it's no wonder the tablet doesn't heat up much. Moreover, Samsung claims that the 8000 mAh battery can offer more than 20 hours of autonomy in video mode. Moving on to charging, Samsung says there is support for 45W fast charging, but I tested this claim with a 65W AC adapter and a USB-C cable certified for 45W charging, original Samsung accessories, and measured only 36-37W power consumed and almost 90 minutes for a full charge. Well, draw your own conclusions. In the \"other features\" chapter, we have a main 12MP camera and an 8MP front camera. Neither is great, at least not in artificial light, but for video calls and those moments when you can't be bothered to reach for a better-equipped phone, it's probably enough. It's also good to know that you can film with the tablet up to 4K resolution at 30 fps. Now let's take another look at the accessories. Even if Samsung recommends it for on-the-go use, the Outdoor Cover should be an essential accessory for anyone with small children around, or if you're clumsy. Built like a tank, the detachable protective case uses hard plastic for crush and twist protection, while shock and impact protection is provided by the very resistant rubber side frame. The Samsung Outdoor Cover has a retractable stand that allows the tablet to be placed in landscape mode. Also, the space for the S Pen accessory is additionally protected, both against impact and accidental loss of the pen. Before ordering, you should know that the Outdoor Cover is a heavy-duty protective case, which adds quite a bit to the thickness and weight of the tablet. If you don't foresee very careless use of the tablet, then maybe it's worth taking a look at other Samsung cases. And we have another interesting optional accessory: the S Pen Creator Edition is a significant upgrade from the S Pen version included in the Tab S9 FE package, with support for Air Actions. If the first can be thought of as a pen or pencil with a thin tip, the S Pen Creator Edition is a little heavier and thicker, enough to feel like you're using a real pencil and not something \"toy-like.\" Helpful is also the tip that very well imitates the shape of a drawing pencil lead. However, to avoid the feeling of slipping on the glossy glass, I also recommend the Note Paper Screen accessory. As the name suggests, this is like a kind of film made of transparent plastic and is placed over the display. The matte-type foil has a specially chosen texture to mimic the feeling of sliding on real paper, and I think it's a must-have, if you know you will work a lot with the pen. The good part is that whichever S Pen version you choose to use, you won't have problems with lag or insufficient sensitivity, both working flawlessly, as you would expect from a latest generation Samsung device. And speaking of accessories, let's discuss a bit about the new Galaxy Buds FE. Worth watching in future promotional campaigns, the Buds FE come at $100 and are a good alternative to the Galaxy Buds2 Pro, which were around $220 at launch. Both are offered in almost identical cases, with a matte finish and the Samsung logo embossed on the Buds2 Pro case, respectively, glossy plastic and printed logo on the Buds FE case. Buds2 Pro have a slightly rounder shape, touch operation, and feel a bit heavier in hand. In contrast, Buds FE have more easily noticeable joint areas and don't feel quite as premium. Fortunately, the performance differences between the two aren't that big. Tested side by side, both have decent bass and a decently high volume. The Hi-Fi sensation is clearly superior on the Buds2 Pro, which come with dedicated speakers for bass and mid-highs, hence probably the noticeable weight difference. While I wouldn't go as far as to say it disappoints, listening on the Buds FE has some downsides regarding the playback of mid-high frequencies, some instruments and nuances being covered by the strong bass. The noise-canceling functionality is also clearly weaker on the FE, with Buds2 Pro maintaining a decisive advantage here. Overall, the Buds FE are certainly not to be avoided, but neither to be bought blindly at full price. And the last but not least interesting accessory of today is this SmartTag2. Along with the Tab S9 FE, Samsung also unveiled the latest version of the SmartTag accessory. Even though it retains the basic functionality unchanged, SmartTag2 comes with a much-improved exterior design and extra features like ultra-wideband connectivity, which was only found in the SmartTag Plus series so far. If the first SmartTag version was rather rudimentary in design, shaped like a slightly thicker plastic coin, SmartTag2 is a much more refined gadget, which you'll probably hate to hide somewhere in your luggage. However, Samsung has also made changes that you might not like, with SmartTag2 no longer being as invisible as the first generation. If the former was basically a coin that you could easily attach anywhere you needed, the new version is more like a stylish keychain, with Samsung seeming to want to get rid of the undesired stalker accessory image, used by jealous lovers. Instead, you can attach the SmartTag2 to a belt or other thicker objects than a cord. And if you really want full flexibility, know that there is also a Rugged Case equipped with a self-locking ring, working like a hook for attaching to various objects, such as luggage or a pet's collar. Samsung has also kept the programmable function button. For example, you can set an emergency message from the SmartThings app, a simple button press sending an SMS with your location data to a trusted person. It should be mentioned that this functionality is not guaranteed in every situation, for example, if you are in an isolated location, and there is no other nearby device to relay the triggered alert. Alright, now that we're done with the accessories, let's answer that thousand points question: is the Galaxy Tab S9 FE a credible Tab S9 alternative? Yes and no. Yes, if you fall into the category of users targeted by Samsung. Are you a student or simply in need of a tablet to work on, possibly on the go? If you want to use the tablet at home for movies, email, or just wasting time on social media, the Tab S9 FE performs admirably in all these roles. It's a slim and lightweight tablet with premium finishes and enough processing power to handle many scenarios. Moreover, it's a tablet priced fairly for what it offers. On the other hand, I don't recommend the Tab S9 FE if you already own a top-tier phone and want your future tablet to be an extension of it. You will feel the performance difference, and we all know what it's like to switch between devices that aren't on the same level. Also, if you want to do video editing on a tablet, play games after manually maxing out all settings, or simply want an experience completely free from compromises, then the Tab S9, with its OLED screen and Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and significantly pricier, remains the obvious choice.

These are some of the choices you'll have to make when choosing between the iPad 10 and the Tab S9 FE. Both tablets are about the same price in the US, but I know the prices around the world are really different. So if you're watching this from outside of the US, please let me know in the comment section where you're from and how much the base models of each of these tablets cost where you live. So the first thing that most people look at is the display. And in that case, the iPad 10 has a 10.9 inch liquid retina 60 hertz display with a resolution of 1640 by 2360, a four by three aspect ratio and 264 pixels per inch. The tab S9 FE+ has an IPS LCD display, which offers a faster 90 hertz adaptive refresh rate, a higher resolution of 1600 by 2560, but a lower pixel density of 243 pixels per inch. In terms of image quality, both displays are sharp and crisp, and if I'm being critical, the iPad has better color accuracy and the tab S9 FE+ is a bit warmer and has a slight greenish tint. I do prefer the 90 hertz on the tab S9 FE+ because things like UI animations and scrolling looks smoother. Now 60 hertz has never been a deal breaker for me, and right now I'm using three different phones, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Samsung S24 Ultra, and the Pixel 8 Pros, all of which have 120 hertz displays. But I think that a higher refresh rate is a nice to have, but not critical for most tasks on a mobile device. Now there are exceptions of course, like some games and we'll get to that in the dedicated gaming section of this video. In terms of aspect ratios, with the iPad 10, we're getting a four by three aspect ratio, which is really nice when taking handwritten notes using the Apple pencil. But overall, the tab S9 FE is still wider in portrait mode because the tablet is larger. The FE+ is better suited for watching video because the 16 by 10 aspect ratio is closer to most content and the image is larger and has smaller black bars. Now another important difference is that the tab S9 FE+ has a fully laminated display. So the display, the touch layer and the cover glass are fused together into a single display assembly and the image looks like it's printed right on top of the glass. On the iPad 10, there is an air gap between the display and the combination of cover glass and touch layer. For a lot of things like watching movies, surfing the web or playing games. It's not really something that you're going to notice unless you really look for it, but when you're using the stylus, it does make a difference. With the iPad 10, you'll be able to see separation between the tip of the Apple pencil and the content that's being created, especially if you're looking at an angle. With the tab S9 FE+, because the image looks like it's right on top of the glass, it's going to look like the tip of the S Pen is actually touching the line or the content that you're creating, which of course is better. But the one advantage of a non laminated display is that if the display gets damaged or scratched, most of the time it's just the cover glass so the replacement is relatively inexpensive. With a fully laminated display, the entire display assembly has to be replaced, even if it's just a scratch on the cover glass. I'll also get to a few other important stylist differences in just a moment, but first, let's talk about gaming. So I play a ton on my tablets and I was really curious. I really wanted to see how these tablets would match up. Now overall, I was able to play my usual games on both tablets and that includes Genshin, Asphalt, PUBG, and then of course some less demanding games. But there was an obvious difference in both processing power and GPU performance, which did have an impact on my experience when I played more resource intensive games. Now I'll quickly show you the benchmarks in the performance section, but gaming was one of those areas where I could very clearly notice the advantage of the older but more capable A14 bionic chip on the iPad 10 when compared with the Exynos 1380 on the tab S9 FE+. Using PUBG as an example, gameplay was smoother and more responsive on the iPad. I could play with balanced graphics and extreme frame rate versus balanced graphics and high frame rate on the tab S9 FE+. So even though the FE+ display can technically reach a faster 90 FPS, it didn't result in a practical advantage for PUBG. I had a similar experience with Genshin where again just performed better on the iPad 10 even though it has less RAM than the Tab S9 FE+. Now, I always like to mention that we know game developers will look to push the CPU and GPU and games are going to evolve and start to demand more and more resources. So if I'm looking to keep a device for at least four to five years or even longer, I'm always going to opt for a tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance so that it continues to perform well into the future. Now, if you wanna stream and play Xbox Games with the Xbox Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox control with both tablets and have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection and I'll give the edge to the FE+ because of the larger display. Now another area where the tab S9 FE+ comes out ahead is storage. So the iPad 10 starts out with 64 gigabytes of internal storage versus 128 gigabytes on the tab S9 FE+. Now to give you a sense of what that means, iPad OS currently takes up a little over 10 gigabytes of storage, system data takes up another 11 gigs, and PUBG uses up a little over 20 gigs with the maps and resources that I have downloaded. So that's 41 of the 64 available gigs already used up with no other apps, files or photos. And both tablets are also available with a 256 gigabyte option. With the iPad, that's an additional 150 bucks and with the tab S9 FE+, it's an extra $100 which also gives you a bump in RAM, but we'll cover that in the configuration section. Now the FE+ also has a micro SD card slot, which allows you to expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte and you can use this storage for files, for photos, for videos, and for most apps. Now, when we look at the overall design of these tablets, both tablets are machined aluminum, both have rounded corners and squared off edges, but the Tab S9 FE+ is larger and has slightly smaller bezels. We're getting a fingerprint sensor incorporated into the power button with both devices. On the iPad 10, it's on the short side, on the Tab S9 FE+ it's on the longer side and both have been very accurate and responsive for me. The iPad 10 has four speaker grills versus two on the tab S9 FE+, but both tablets only have two speakers, one on each side. In terms of audio quality, both are good. You know, they're not as good as the higher end models and between these two, the tab S9 FE+ speakers are a little bit louder and they sound brighter. Another nice feature about the FE+ is that it has an IP 68 rating, so we're getting protection from water and dust. Now obviously this is important if you take your tablet with you when you travel or if you use it outside a lot, but even around the house it's super nice to have additional protection from accidental spills, especially you know if you have kind of an active dog. Now both tablets use a USB-C port for charging and connecting accessories, which brings me to the stylus and keyboard option. But the FE+ comes with a free S Pen, which can be stored on the side or the back of the tablet. It has a programmable button and it doesn't need to be charged in order to write or draw. The iPad 10 is compatible with the first generation Apple pencil, which costs $99. It pairs and charges using a cable and requires a lightning to USB-C adapter. The iPad is also compatible with the newer USB-C Apple pencil, which charges and pairs with a wire and doesn't require an adapter. It costs $79, doesn't offer pressure sensitivity, but it does magnetically attach to the side of the iPad. In terms of the actual writing experience, the Apple pencil has a firm tip, so it's a little harsher when it hits the glass and it feels like you're writing or drawing on a single sheet of paper that's placed on a hard surface. The S Pen has a softer tip, so when it hits the glass, it gives a little and it feels more like you're writing on a full pad of paper where the pages compress as you press down. Now, one isn't objectively better than the other for every use, and it's going to come down to what feels better for you so hopefully this description was helpful. When we look at keyboard cases with track pads, the Tab S9 FE+ uses the book cover keyboard and the iPad 10 uses a magic keyboard folio. Both have a similar design with detachable keyboard and an adjustable back. The Samsung book cover keyboard is larger, it can be angled farther back so it's more adjustable. It also has a bump out for the S Pen, so it's always protected. At the same time, the magic keyboard folio is more solidly built. It has better keys and a more responsive and more accurate track pad. Now, one final advantage of the magic keyboard folio is that the keyboard can be flipped and reattached so that when it folds back, the keys are not exposed. As far as camera systems, the iPad has a more capable rear facing camera in terms of resolution and frame rate, but the tab S9 FE+ has a wide and an ultra wide camera. Practically speaking, I don't really use the rear facing cameras on my tablet, so for me, that's not a huge deciding factor. Both tablets have a 12 megapixel front facing camera and here's a quick sample. Here's a camera and microphone comparison of the iPad 10 and the Tab S9 FE+. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect from each tablet. I also like the fact that in both cases the camera is placed in the center of the long edge and this way you're always properly framed for video calls. Now, when we talked about gaming, I mentioned the performance of the iPad's A14 bionic and the FE+'s Exynos 1380. So let's quickly look at single and multicore performance where we see the Apple chip pull ahead. We also see it score noticeably higher in GPU performance, which helps explain some of the differences we saw. Now of course, these are just benchmark scores, so what about typical everyday use? Well, if you're surfing the web, watching video or going on social media, it doesn't really mean much and you can easily do that with both tablets, but the iPad definitely feels snappier and more responsive and it should continue to perform better for longer. If you're doing something like heavy photo or video editing, then again the iPad would be a better option. When multitasking, the iPad can run two apps in split view plus additional apps in a slide over window. The Tab S9 FE+ can run three tiled apps with more flexibility when it comes to how much real estate each app takes. It can also run multiple floating windows, which can be resized and can even change the transparency. And on top of that, it has a larger display. Now both tablets have a customizable dock, but the Tab S9 FE+ also has a super handy side panel for quick access. Both tablets can be used as additional displays for compatible desktops and laptops. Apple calls this feature sidecar and Samsung calls it second screen. And these are great features for both tablets, so you should definitely use them. But if you're looking for more of a laptop replacement, the tab S9 FE+ has DeX, which I love but there is one limitation. If you're new to Samsung tablets, DeX essentially reboots the tablet with an OS that looks very similar to what you get on a laptop. You've got a task bar where you can minimize and see active apps. You have an actual desktop with icons and you can run multiple floating windows or snap windows to the sides of the display. But unlike with the Tab S9, S9+ and S9 Ultra, you can't connect an external display and then run a dual display set up with the FE+. And if you wanna learn more about that, watch this full comparison. Now the iPad 10 does let you mirror your display to an external display, but it doesn't stretch out to use the entire monitor because the iPad 10 doesn't fully support stage manager and it's not an extended display. So when it comes to being a laptop replacement, it's still a win for the tab S9 FE+, but not quite as good as what you get with the higher end models. Now battery life is always interesting because it does come down to what you actually do. Now, comparing these devices when they were new, I'm looking at about 10 hours with the iPad 10 and about 13 to 14 hours from the tab S9 FE+. Again, depending on what I was doing. Now, of course these times aren't with me gaming the entire time and they include surfing the web, watching video, and working with productivity and social media apps. When you're looking for available apps, the Google Play Store, the Galaxy Store and the Apple App Store have tons of options for pretty much everything that you need. In general, I'm still going to give the edge to the iPad 10 because the apps seem to be better optimized for a tablet. But as I've said in other recent videos, the gap continues to close as several creative apps like Affinity Photo and Procreate are only available for the iPad. But it's great to see that there is an Android version of LumaFusion. Now both tablets run the latest available operating systems and Samsung promises four years of OS updates and five years of security updates. Apple devices typically get longer support than that, and when I take into account the improved CPU and GPU performance, I'm going to give the iPad the edge in terms of longevity. It's also super important that you consider the other products that you own, which make up your ecosystem. Samsung has made some wonderful improvements over the past few years, adding much needed integration between multiple devices, things like wireless file and text sharing and additional cross device integrations. And even though the gap continues to shrink, Apple's ecosystem is still more complete and more tightly integrated due to the fact that they have full control of the hardware and the software on all their devices. And when we look at the configuration options and prices from the official stores, we already talked about the storage options, but both the 64 and the 256 gigabytes models of the iPad 10 come with four gigabytes of RAM. With the FE+, the 128 gigabyte model comes with eight gigs of ram, and the 256 gigabyte model comes with 12. There are also some great discounts going on right now, and I make sure to update the links in the description when I find better ones. So here's how I look at this decision. The iPad 10 is smaller and lighter. It's more powerful and it will be more capable if you plan on keeping your device for many years and you like to play more demanding games at higher settings or plan on performing other resource intensive tasks. It also offers better optimized apps, exclusive access to some creative specific apps and better long term support. The Tab S9 FE+ is larger. It offers additional protection with an IP 68 rating. It comes with a free S Pen, more storage on the base model, expandable storage, more capable multitasking, and better battery life. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.- As soon as we compare these two displays, we immediately see some super important differences. You see, there are times where you can get a better value by spending less money, but there are also times when spending more is actually worth it. So when Samsung released the FE or Fan Edition version of the Tab S9, I was super curious to see if it's a better value than the flagship version or if more is actually more. And to be clear, there's a massive price difference right now with the FE version being half the price of the flagship model. Now, starting out with the displays, they're very close in terms of size, they have the same aspect ratio. You have 16 by 10, which makes them great for watching content. But in terms of specs, that's pretty much where the similarities end. The Tab S9 has an 11 inch dynamic AMOLED 2X display, which offers 120 hertz adaptive refresh rate, a resolution of 1600 by 2560, and a pixel density of 274 pixels per inch. The Tab S9 FE has a 10.9 inch IPS LCD display, which offers a slower 90 hertz adaptive refresh rate, a lower resolution of 1440 by 2304, and a lower pixel density of 249 pixels per inch. In terms of image quality, the FE display is actually quite good and I'm super happy with the image quality for watching video and for playing games. I also love that we're getting 90 hertz versus the 50 hertz we got on the Tab S7 FE. But there's no question that the dynamic AMOLED 2X display on the flagship model is the better display. Colors seem to pop off the screen, we're getting outstanding blacks, better contrast, and the UI animations look smoother. Overall, I'm clearly going to give the edge to the Tab S9, but it's definitely not twice as good as a Tab S9 FE. The two tablets have a similar design with a full aluminum frame and back. They have the same footprint, but the Tab S9 is a bit thinner. I do love that Samsung was able to bring the IP68 rating down to the FE version, giving both tablets protection from water and dust. This is great if you take your tablet with you to work or school or when you travel, but it's also a super nice feature if you're using it around the house and you have a dog with an aggressive tail. Now, both tablets offer face recognition for biometric authentication and a more secure fingerprint sensor. With the Tab S9, we're getting an under display fingerprint sensor and with the FE, it's integrated into the power button. Both sensors have worked great for me and are super responsive and accurate, but I prefer the under display version on the Tab S9 because it's more natural to how I hold the tablet. And both tablets have a micro SD card slot, so we can upgrade the internal storage by up to one terabyte and we can use that internal storage for photos, videos, files, and for most apps. Now, continuing to look around the edges, we're getting four AKG tuned speakers on the Tab S9 versus two on the FE. And the flagship model definitely has a more full sound. The audio seems warmer and has more presence to it, which makes it a better choice for watching content. Another area where I noticed a difference is gaming. Now, I play a lot on my tablets and I was really curious to see how these processors match up. So I was able to play my usual games like Genshin, Asphalt, and PUBG, and of course some less demanding games on both tablets, but there was an obvious difference in both processing power and GPU performance, which did have an impact on more resource-intensive games. We'll quickly go over benchmarks in the performance section, but there's no question that Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip in the Tab S9 is more capable than the Exynos 1380 in the FE version. Using PUBG as an example, gameplay was smoother and more responsive on the Tab S9 and I could play with graphics set to smooth and frame rate set to 90 FPS. I could also set graphics anywhere from balanced to HDR and frame rate set to extreme or ultra HD for graphics and ultra for frame rate. With the FE model, I was limited to high frame rate, whether graphics were set to smooth, balanced or HD, and that was as good as it got so I definitely couldn't get to 90 FPS. Playing Genshin Impact, I had a very similar experience where it was playable on both devices, but performed better on the Tab S9, again, because of the more capable processor and the additional RAM, which I'll discuss in a bit. If gaming is a priority for you, then looking ahead, we know that game developers are going to push the CPU and GPU and games are going to evolve and start to demand more and more resources. When I look to keep a device for at least four or five years, I'm always going to opt for the tablet that has better CPU and GPU performance than I need right now so that it continues to perform well in the future. Now, if you wanna stream and play Xbox Games with the Xbox Game Pass app, you can pair an Xbox controller with both tablets and have extremely smooth gameplay as long as you have a reliable internet connection. Now, both tablets start out with 120 gigabytes of storage and have a 256 gigabyte model. So there's no advantage in terms of space for games and you can't really go wrong here.

And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this portion of the video. Now, back to the tablets. Another factor to consider is the ability to expand the functionality of each tablet by adding a keyboard case and a stylus. Now, both tablets are compatible with the same two versions of book cover keyboard from Samsung. And of course, you can always use an external Bluetooth keyboard instead. Now, both tablets also come with a free S Pen, which can be stored on the side or on the back of the tablet, but only the Tab S9 has a Bluetooth enabled S Pen, which offers some wireless functionality for things like camera control and media playback. Now, in terms of the actual writing experience, it's virtually identical and neither requires a charge in order to write or draw. Looking at the camera systems, the Tab S9 has the 13 megapixel rear facing camera versus 8 megapixel on the Tab S9. Both tablets have a 12 megapixel selfie camera. And here's a quick sample. This is a camera and microphone test of the Tab S9 and the Tab S9 Fe. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect for video calls. Now, I briefly mentioned performance when we talked about gaming. So let's quickly look at the single and multi-core performance of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and the Exynos 1380, where we see the Snapdragon chip pull way ahead. We also see it score considerably higher in GPU performance, which helps explain some of the differences we saw when gaming. Now, of course, these are just benchmark scores, so beyond the impact on gaming, what about typical real life use? Well, if you're surfing the web, watching video, or going on social media, you'll definitely be able to do that with both tablets, but the Tab S9 feels snappier and more responsive. Even just navigating around the UI and opening and closing apps, you can notice the difference and I would expect it to continue to perform better for longer. Now, of course, for more demanding things like photo or video editing, the Tab S9 is the more capable option. But always keep in mind what you plan on doing because you are paying twice as much. Both tablets run the latest Android and One UI so you're getting all the latest features like three tiled apps, pop-up windows, and of course decks, which is awesome. Essentially, it reboots the tablet and gives you an operating system that is very similar to a desktop OS. You're getting a task bar, a desktop with icons, multiple windows, you can snap windows, and you can use a keyboard case to transform your tablet to more of a laptop replacement. One major difference is that you can only connect an external display and then run a super capable dual display setup with the Tab S9. The FE version doesn't have this feature. But you can use either tablet as an additional display for your laptop or desktop with Samsung's Second Screen. And this is a super handy feature when you travel. As far as OS and security updates, Samsung promises four years of OS updates and five years of security updates, which is nice. And again, keep in mind the difference in performance if you plan on keeping your tablet for a while. Looking at battery life, the flagship model has a larger 8,400 mAh battery versus 8,000 on the FE. But Samsung rates the FE model at 18 hours versus 15 on the Tab S9. Now, that I have the entire Tab S9 and FE lineup, I'm reshooting my battery test. So go ahead and subscribe to be notified when it's published. Now, both tablets offer 45 watt fast charging, but neither ships with a charging adapter so that's something that you'll need to get separately. Now, when we look at the configuration options, both start out with 120 gigabytes of internal storage. The Tab S9 comes with 8 gigs of RAM, and the FE model comes with 6 gigs of RAM. If we upgrade to 256 gigabytes of storage on both models, then we're getting 12 gigs of RAM on the Tab S9 and 8 on the FE. So there's no question that the Tab S9 is the more capable tablet. It has a better display, a much more powerful chip with better CPU and GPU performance, better speakers, a better camera system, and a more capable S Pen. But the Tab S9 FE is an outstanding value when you consider the price. If you don't need the best performance or the absolute best display, you're getting a lot of the same features with better battery life for half the price. Now, you should see how the Tab S9 FE compares with the iPad 10. Hopefully this comparison was helpful. Click on my face to subscribe. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.- Okay, so you're thinking of buying a Galaxy Tab S9 series tablet and you realize that there are three great options, but Samsung actually did something this year to make the decision even harder. So let's talk about all the important differences. This way you can have all the information that you need to choose the right Tab S9 series tablet for you. Starting out, we have the Tab S9 which got the most significant changes in this year's lineup. It retails for 799, and right now, using the links in the description, you can actually double the storage and get 50% more RAM for the same price, but we'll come back to that later. So over the past few years, Samsung didn't give the best displays to the smallest versions, like the Tab S7 and the Tab S8. It was still a very nice display, but it was an LCD display. Now, this year, the Tab S9 got the same upgrade as its two bigger siblings, and now it's sporting an amazing dynamic AMOLED 2X display. It's an 11-inch 120 hertz display with a resolution of 1,600 by 2,560, a 16 by 10 aspect ratio, and 274 pixels per inch. The display gives you the choice between a static 60 hertz or adaptive 120 hertz where the tablet changes in real time based on what you're doing. And this way you can save on battery life when you're looking at static content and you can get smooth and responsive animations when you're interacting with a UI, playing games, or doing anything else where a faster refresh rate offers the optimal user experience. This display has noticeably darker black levels than the previous models. It has better color accuracy, better contrast, and reduced blue light emission. The Tab S9 comes in graphite or beige. And looking around the edges, we see four speaker grills with four AKG-tuned speakers. In terms of audio quality, they're quite good for this size tablet and they work well for watching content and for games that don't require you to quickly identify where sounds are coming from. Obviously, for those types of games, you're better off using headsets, and there's a speaker test of all three tablets later on in this video when I talk about the Tab S9 Ultra. Now back to the Tab S9, we're getting a USB-C for charging and connecting accessories, and there's a micro SD cart slot which allows you to expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. Now, speaking of accessories, the Tab S9 comes with a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen. We're getting lower latency than last year's model, and it has bidirectional charging, so it doesn't matter which way you snap it to the back. Both the tablet and the S Pen have an IP68 rating, so you're getting protection from water and dust. And the Tab S9 is compatible with two keyboard cases from Samsung, the Book Cover Keyboard and the Book Cover Keyboard Slim. For biometric authentication, we got another upgrade from last year, and now we've got an outstanding under display fingerprint sensor to go along with facial recognition. This year, we also got a really impressive upgrade in performance with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, which has better single core performance in the last year's model and even greater improvement in multi-core and GPU performance. And the new Qualcomm chip also helps improve battery life. So on top of getting a larger battery this year at 8,400 milliampere-hour versus 8,000, we're also getting a more efficient chip. And I'm finishing up a detailed battery drain test of all three models. I'll also put the Tab S8 series test in the description if you want to check out those results. The Tab S9 gives us outstanding multitasking capabilities with three tiled apps at the same time, popup windows, and then of course DeX. If you're not familiar with it, DeX essentially reboots the tablet and gives you an operating system that's very similar to a desktop OS. You're getting a task bar, a desktop with icons, multiple windows. You can snap windows, and you can use a keyboard case to transform your tablet into more of a laptop replacement. You can also connect an external display keyboard and mouse and then run a super capable dual display setup. Now, one other great option is to use the Tab S9 as an additional display for your laptop or desktop with Samsung's Second Screen. This is a super handy feature when you travel. For cameras, we're getting a 13-megapixel front-facing camera and a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera. And for connectivity, we're getting Wi-Fi 6E compatibility just like with the two larger models. Looking at the configuration options, the 128-gigabyte model comes with eight gigs of RAM, and the 256-gigabyte model comes with 12 gigs of RAM. And remember that you can use the links in the description to get that upgrade for free, which is something that I would highly recommend doing. Ultimately, this is an extremely powerful and capable tablet at this price point. It's also a great option for someone who values portability, for users who prefer this size for gaming, or for users with smaller hands who find a smaller tablet easier to handle. Moving onto the Tab S9+, which starts out at $999. We're essentially getting the same design, but in a larger form factor. We're now getting the same type of display, dynamic AMOLED 2X, but it's larger at 12.4 inches. We're getting a higher resolution at 1,752 by 2,800, the same aspect ratio of 16 by 10, and a slightly lower pixel density, but not something that's really noticeable in terms of sharpness. Now, watching content on this display is fantastic. The image quality is outstanding. And since the aspect ratio is so close to the image that's being displayed, they're very small black bars at the top and the bottom. Also, if you fill to zoom, you're getting a very minor crop and then the image covers the entire display and looks great. Again, we're getting four AKG-tuned speakers, but these are warmer and fuller than the ones on the Tab S9. We're getting the same USB-C 3.2 ports, same Bluetooth 5.3, and Wi-Fi 6E compatibility, but a larger battery than the Tab S9 at 10,090 milliampere-hour. And like all three tablets, we're getting fast wire charging at 45 watts. Now, keep in mind that none of these tablets come with a charger, and I'll put some links in the description to a few of my favorites. We have the same options for biometric authentication with an under-display fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. We're getting the same S Pen with the same low latency, and the same IP68 protection for the S Pen and the tablet. Now, even though we have the same multitasking features, the larger display on the Tab S9+ gives the edge over the smaller Tab S9, and that's true for multiple tiled apps, for DeX, and when we're using it as an external display. When it comes to gaming, this model might be the sweet spot in terms of size. You're getting a larger display, but it's not too big, so it's great for handheld games and when you wanna connect to controller, and then stream some games using the Xbox Game Pass app. It has the same 13-megapixel front-facing camera as the Tab S9. But in addition to the 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, it also has an eight-megapixel ultra wide. We're getting the same powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, but the Tab S9+ starts with 256 gigabytes and 12 gigs if RAM. And again, right now you can double the storage and get the 512 gigabyte model for the same price. The Tab S9+ is right there in the middle. It's giving you a noticeably larger display, a slightly better camera module, better speakers, a larger battery, and more storage. All right, so now we move on to the Tab S9 Ultra, which starts out at $1,199. It's the biggest tablet that Samsung makes, and it's what some people would say is inarguably the best display on any tablet. Now, whether you agree or not, if you've had a chance to use this tablet in real life, you have to admit that this display is spectacular. It's massive at 14.6 inches, still dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120 hertz. It has the highest resolution at 1,848 by 2,960 the same 16 by 10 aspect ratio, and a pixel density of 239. Now, surprisingly, the Tab S9 Ultra is the thinnest of all three tablets. It's not by a lot, but when you couple the larger size with the thinnest tablet, the user experience is that of using some sort of a futuristic display. I'll admit that it's probably not for everyone. It's definitely the least portable option, although, honestly, for me, I always carry it in my backpack. So it doesn't really impact me in that context, but there is one specific area where it's actually too big, and I'll get to that in just a minute. And we're getting all the same biometric features the same connectivity, same IP68 rating, but we do see another change when it comes to the camera module. So we have the 13-megapixel wide and the eight-megapixel ultra wide that we saw on the Tab S9+ on the back of the tablet. But on the front we're now getting two 13-megapixel cameras with a wide and an ultra wide. We're also getting a small notch which is something that I feel like I have to address. So I've heard both sides of the argument and my perspective in short is that it just doesn't matter. The display is so big and the notch is like this big. It's so tiny that I never really notice it. Now, of course, if it's something that you're gonna be fixated on, then it's not really the tablet for you and you should probably go with something like the Tab S9+. But it's just never really been an issue or in the way for any of the ways that I use this tablet. The Tab S9 Ultra is right now my favorite tablet to watch content on. The fact that I can get an image to be this big, this close to me is super impressive. We're also getting the best audio quality using the built-in speakers. And here's a quick sample from all three tablets. (\"On & On\") ♪ Hold me close 'til I get up ♪ ♪ Time is barely on our side ♪ ♪ I don't wanna waste what's left ♪ ♪ The storms we chase are leading us ♪ ♪ And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah ♪ ♪ No, I don't wanna waste what's left ♪ ♪ And on and on we'll go ♪ ♪ Through the wastelands, through the highways ♪ ♪ 'Til my shadow turns to sun rays ♪ ♪ And on and on we'll go ♪ ♪ Through the wastelands, through the highways ♪ ♪ And on and on we'll go ♪ - We're getting the largest battery of all three at 11,200 milliampere-hours, but of course it has to power the largest display, so I'm super excited to show you my battery test, and make sure that you're subscribed so you don't miss out. For multitasking DeX and second screen, this is the best option because it's such a useful size and you can have so much content on it and you can really improve your productivity. Now, the one area where this tablet was too big for me was when I'm playing \"PUBG\" and holding it in the air. It just feels cumbersome and my hands get pretty tired after a couple games. Now, if you play with a tablet flat on the desk or on a pillow, then that's another completely different story. And in that case, I love having the larger display because it's easier to see smaller movements. It's definitely the best tablet to use with a controller because it's like having a super light and portable TV with you anywhere you go. For configuration options, it starts out with 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 12 gigs of RAM. And again, you can double the storage right now for the same price. And if you go to one terabyte, you also get bumped up to 16 gigabytes of RAM. If you want the biggest tablet with the biggest display for watching content, if you multitask, use your tablet as a laptop replacement with DeX, or use it for second screen, and if you want the largest gaming display Samsung offers in a tablet, get yourself a Tab S9 Ultra. It's probably my favorite tablet in the lineup. And this display just puts a smile on my face every time I use it. And whenever a new person sees me using it for the first time, it's super obvious that there is something very special about this tablet. Now you should check out this comparison. Hopefully this video is helpful. Click on my face to subscribe. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck and see you soon.I've tried to replace my laptop with an Android tablet and I would like to share my experience with you let me just tell you how I felt it was really really bad won't recommend doing this I previously did this experiment with a game console and an iPad but it's going to be a lot worse this time the primary issue I faced while using my iPad as my primary device was that all the apps that were present was actually a trim down version of their original counterparts but it's going to be tougher on the Android tablet the thing is that Android still lacks a lot of Pro apps and that my friend is a real issue let's take a deep breath and a deep dive in into this my name is praj and let's get started I'll be trying out this experiment with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Fe plus my primary task were managing my schedule scripting and editing my videos creating thumbnails and producing music if you are a programmer I think you can now get vs code for Android not really sure about this one so I'll be leaving a link in the description and you can check it out yourself let's start with something easy managing my schedule I maintain my work and content schedule using to theist and notion this is one aspect where I faed no issues at all it was actually more convenient managing my schedule using my tablet compared to a PC for example the inhand feel really gives a subtle touch to it was able to navigate quite nicely if you have a stylus it can become a lot more easier the S Spen came right out of the box on this tablet so yeah that was a good addition one thing I must point out if you're a student then this will come in real Handy you will be able to take handwritten notes and manage your PDFs using this tablet itself if you have a Samsung tablet then you also get access to good notes for Android it has been one of the most popular not taking apps for the iPad but the Android version is still in a very weird State I talked about this issue on the different video I'll leave a link in the description in case you're interested in that it's the same when it comes to the entertainment sides of things you can binge watch your favorite shows on Netflix Prime video or whatever you're into you will get a great Visual and audio experience if you use a Windows laptop then you know this very well the speakers of Windows laptop simply suck you're going to have a far better audio experience using this one since it's an Android tablet you can game quite nicely using this one one issue that you'll be facing while playing games is that most games won't be optimized for tablet they will just stretch to fit your tablet if you don't mind this issue then you're good to go also you'll have a better battery life compared to any laptop you should keep this in mind the social media apps for the iPad is just not optimized this is how Instagram looks on iPad and this is how Instagram looks on Android tablets well done meta another aspect that I really enjoyed was scripting my videos like a previously mentioned in my iPad video I used to use Google talks to script but now I switched to simple note it's clean it's more convenient and it's present for every platform I obviously didn't type using the default keyboard it's much easier if you just connect a Bluetooth keyboard and also a mouse it will make your life so much easier also you'll be able to enjoy the process more it will handle lightweight task quite nicely the multitask window will help you get a lot done if you do a lot of research related stuff and take notes along with it I really use this split screen mode a lot it simply speeds up my workflow and also if you're enjoying this video so far then i' would really appreciate if you could quickly hit that subscribe button that will help me out a lot let's talk about photo editing I've been editing my photos on Lightroom and it's so therapeutic the a pen really helps me fine-tune the adjustments it simply feels good editing my photos like this this but now everything changes editing photos was fine but what about creating thumbnails I searched for Photoshop and what I found was Photoshop Express so I had to download canva I never thought I'd be doing this as I love creating my thumbnails it really helps me get that Personal Touch as I have more controls in Photoshop in canva you can basically use the templates to create your own thumbnail many people actually use this and it's an easy way to get some great results if you are new into graphic designing but I've spent a lot of years on Photoshop so it doesn't really make sense for me but nevertheless here I go I was actually a ble to receive some satisfactory results in the thumbnail department but things get even worse now how do I edit my videos here I used a resol to edit my videos on a computer but it isn't available on Android I had to choose between Luma fusion and Premier Rush Premier Rush is basically a trim down version of Adobe Premier Pro I used to use Premier Pro before switching to Davi so I thought of giving Premier Rush a try I was able to get some basic edits and adjustments done to didn't really do anything Advanced over here on iPad we had the full version of dingi resolve it allowed me to get exactly what I wanted in my edit but it wasn't the case over here I simply had to adjust with what I had and also it wasn't really stable I work with a lot of 4K videos Premier rush just like other Adobe products crashed a lot of times sorry Adobe it was really inconvenient to be honest for editing minor videos and creating reels and shorts it should work totally fine but if you want to get some heavy editing done it's better you stick to using your laptop it won't be able to handle such a task also the expose time would be really high with 4K footage so you should keep that in mind if you're a digital artist however I would recommend that you use an iPad procreate is such a great app and it's only available for the iPad they have also recently released a new app called procreate dreams and that basically allows us to create high quality animations just right in your iPad I've been using this app called infinite painter on my Android tablet it's a great app I must say but I would still prefer procreate it's so much better one good thing was that record box is there for Android it's a industry standard DS software that everyone uses so if you wanted to be a DJ and get your hands on the industry standard software then you'll be able to get that quite easily but unlike the iPad you will be able to import your music that you already own locally that's one major benefit of using Android over Apple devices DJing was taken care of but music production is really going to be challenging over here my primary door of choice is FL Studio we only have a mobile version of FL Studio for Android and that was very sad and in this version of FL Studio mobile I wouldn't really want to make music in this app it's only good for maybe programming drums and creating some cords perh apps in iPad we had access to logic pro which is a great software for music production many Pros use it too but I couldn't really find a good alternative here on Android to be honest the closest app I could find was actually band lab it had a good library of virtual instruments and it was fairly easy to create Cs and M notes using this app check this out if you're into music production so would you be able to use an Android tablet as your primary computer I certainly can it would be too much limiting for me in the larger Spectrum your smartphone lies on one side your laptop lies on the other the iPad basically lies in the middle but the Android tablets fall a little behind the iPad as of today do let me know your thoughts in the comments I would really like to hear them there are many interesting apps that you can use to be more more Mindful and in return be more productive click here to check out the best productivity apps that will help you Kickstart 2024 thanks for watching please consider subscribing to my channel and I hope to see you [Music] thereHello and welcome back to my channel! In today's video, I'm thrilled to share the unboxing experience for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE I was eager to get a tablet for more efficient studying and creating illustrations without the need for stacks of paper! As some of you know, I also create merch inspired by K-pop and adorable characters, stickers and memo pads with charming designs. Feel free to check out my creations on my Instagram and Etsy @kibimistudio There's something for every lover of cuteness! 🌈💕 This model comes with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage in an elegant gray color I would have preferred a different color, but this one was on sale, and since I'll be adding a case, I don't mind! It comes with a Samsung pen and a USB Type-C cable I was surprised it didn't come with a screen protector😶 Let's power it on and set up the basic parameters! I discovered it has fingerprint unlock — what a surprise! I always forgot it comes with a pen, no need to use my finger😅 Now, let's try out Samsung Notes In a future clip, I'll show you my notes as I explore its features Yes, definitely much better with a white sheet! 📄 Time to set a wallpaper! This one lasted less than 24 hours because I added my illustration as soon as I could! 🎨 Hello again! Two weeks have passed, and I've received everything I ordered from AliExpress: a case, tempered glass, and a pen case. All for less than 20€! Ugg... the pen case was a little difficult to put on... Finally! Even with the cover the magnet still works🌈💕 LOOK AT THIS ADORABLE CASE!!😍 Now, everything is protected :3 Let me show you quickly my Samsung notes Thank you so much for watching my video. See you in the next one!🧡✨\n"

The reason is ridiculous - Samsung integrated a Samsung account into it, and if you can&#39;t sign in into your Samsung account you can&#39;t pass the initial setup process, which means you cannot use the tablet. My two-factor authentication phone number on Samsung account is the old one, and I couldn&#39;t pass the initial setup because of that. Spent several days, many hours with Samsung tech support, there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what, against their policy, which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what, ever. So, I couldn&#39;t complete the initial setup and had to return it. Stupidity is on the next level.\n",

My two-factor authentication phone number on Samsung account is the old one, and I couldn&#39;t pass the initial setup because of that. Spent several days, many hours with Samsung tech support, there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what, against their policy, which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what, ever.

At this point, we had SSD drives that are pretty darn small and can be attached right to the back of a device offering 1, 2 or even 4 TB&#39;s of storage dirt cheap.  The world of tablets continues to get better.   Start with apps you want.  Android is useless if your favorite app isn&#39;t supported!

And don’t forget Apple is raising their prices on their new OLED models by hundreds of dollars. 😅<br><br>I just got the S9+ for $350 dollars less than the current iPad Pro with same configuration! Crazy. And did I mention I get a stylus with the S9+ and not with Apple?\n",
      "Thankss for the audio side by side.... as an audio tech, the audio is important to me. It amazes me what samsung and Dolby do with tiny speakers!\n",
      "Hello, please give me your wallpaper Thankyou so much\n",
      "Nice comparison video ❤ thank you, really helpful 😊\n",
      "image quality is not even close try watching in complete darkness and the OLED on samsung will look 100x better you can see the blooming on miniLED holoing effect and bad near dark scenes (2% and 5% greys look awful) I went with S9 plus\n",
      "Having the two of them... with Apple you got to pay extra and way too much for: The Pen (not included), pencil hover &quot;novelty&quot; (with Samsung has been present for years), extra RAM, extra storage, good quality sound, 120Hz, brighter screen, etc. Moreover, the Apple pencil sucks (Come on, 130 bucks for outdated technology? It has been untouched for more than 4 years now) and is so unconfortable to use, give it a try to the S pen and you will never look back at the Apple pencil. Apple Notes is trash if you are a serious note-taker (writing two words on a screen does not account as serious note-taking). Please guys, be exigent, you are giving them your hard-earned money, and being fanboys is just stupid. Samsung is improving year after year, Apple has been in a confort zone for years now, our fault.\n",
      "I have both. The S9+ has a much better display(oled), better speakers, and the front facing camera is in a landscapemode(perfect for videocalls). Moreover, the image on videocalls on the Samsung is superior to the iPad Pro.\n",
      "which one I should go with guys? My use cases: reading, writing, watching movies, need software stability in long run, planning to keep it for atleast 6 years...\n",
      "Is there some setting in google that allows you to turn on Google play card because I look and can&#39;t find anything\n",
      "Which is more practical for an 11 year old,<br>A tab s9 plus<br>Or<br>A tab s9 ultra\n",
      "Great video and I love your content as you are very honest and neutral when comparing these 2 big brands and I love that. I love my Galaxy 9 Ultra and take it with me everywhere. BTW, where do you get the wallpapers from for these tablets? Is there a download link for them?\n",
      "For me, the fact that it has a micro SD card slot is very important. Because I can have several micro sd cards to view my photos taken with my Canon R6 II. And I like the freedom of Android and the 14.6” screen size. And I paid $1,200 for the 512Gb Tab S9 Ultra + Keyboard Cover and S Pen. All in the same package. If it were on the iPad, it would cost around $2,500 here in Brazil. And on the Samsung Brazil website, I am paying $1,200 in 12 installments of $100 per month. 😄. But I have a 10.5” Wi-Fi+4G iPad Pro for when I want something “smaller”.\n",
      "Excellent man! Helped making my decision on buying the Samsung one.\n",
      "For university which one you think should i buy (note taking and social media surf etc.) Samsung tab s9+ or ipad air 5 but 64gb\n",
      "We need those wallpapers !\n",
      "S9+ is the very first device that I had to lower the volume on a speaker test just because how bad it was... Yikes! <br><br>But for real if you need a tablet both are cool. If you need anything more the iPad is vastly superior!\n",
      "I live in Turkey, Samsung Tab S9 Plus 12/256 is 740 dollars, iPad Pro 12.9 M2 128GB is 1500 dollars with Apple Pen 2.\n",

      "I bought and returned S7 just recently. The reason is ridiculous - Samsung integrated a Samsung account into it, and if you can&#39;t sign in into your Samsung account you can&#39;t pass the initial setup process, which means you cannot use the tablet. My two-factor authentication phone number on Samsung account is the old one, and I couldn&#39;t pass the initial setup because of that. Spent several days, many hours with Samsung tech support, there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what, against their policy, which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what, ever. So, I couldn&#39;t complete the initial setup and had to return it. Stupidity is on the next level.\n",

      "FYI friends, to correct our friend,  anything with the ability to plug into a hub, or even direct to external SSD has pretty much unlimited storage for files!   That said, an SD slot is far more convenient, be it  a lot slower than an SSD drive.    At this point, we had SSD drives that are pretty darn small and can be attached right to the back of a device offering 1, 2 or even 4 TB&#39;s of storage dirt cheap.  The world of tablets continues to get better.   Start with apps you want.  Android is useless if your favorite app isn&#39;t supported!   Sadly, many great apps are still iOs only.   :(   Just keep it in mind.\n",

I checked them all at a store and S9 is a quite small in size while the Ultra is very big! 9 plus is in between and I find it perfect for me so I highly recommend it.

      "Solange man vernünftig damit streamen kann, würde mir das vollkommen reichen! Ich brauche kein Tablet für 500€ oder so\n",
      "Wäre dass für Studenten was, oder eher nicht??\n",
      "Lohnt ein Umstieg von einem Samsung a6 585 Modell aus 2016??? Widelive Level L3....\n",
      "Ich frage mich immer bei Reviews zur derlei Geräten : WARUM NUR würde jemand &quot;zum Medienkonsum&quot; 200 € für ein 11-Zoll-Tablet ausgeben, das leicht herunterfallen kann??? Für denselben Preis gibt es einen 32-Zoll-Smart-TV (z. B. fürs Kinderzimmer) oder einen &quot;refurbished&quot; Profi-Laptop mit 14 oder 15,6 Zoll, der x Anschlüsse hat und auch sonst super verwendbar ist – beides Marke. Und wenn es ein Tablet &quot;für die Küche&quot; sein soll, tut&#39;s auch eins mit T606 für den halben Preis. Alle drei gerade genannten Geräte tun in meinem Haushalt brav ihren Dienst.\n",
      "Habe das Tablet seit ein paar Tagen im Einsatz. Ergänzung zu Desktop-PC und Smartphone. Für meine Zwecke absolut o.k. Für unter € 200,- zufrieden. Aber: Kundenservice Xiaomi ist uninformiert. Wer sich nicht traut zu üben und zu versuchen, der verkauft sich mit diesem Gerät schnell. Informationen vom Hersteller mau. Senioren sollten sofort einen VHS-Kurs buchen.\n",
      "Und wie lange bekommt es Update??\n",
      "ich nutze das Honor Pad x9 mit 120Hz und 6 Lautsprechern zum selben Preis, Top\n",
      "Ich hab&#39; mir vor einigen Monaten in einem China-Shop ein 14,1-Zoll-Tablet (Marke Namenlos) für 230 Euro gegönnt (inzwischen unter 200 Euro). Die Freude war von kurzer Dauer. Jedes Wort darüber zu verlieren ist Verschwendung. Es ist einfach Mist in jeder Beziehung. Bei Amazon für 291 Euro zu finden.<br>Habe mich von der Grösse verführen lassen.\n",
      "Habe heute das 4GB Redmi Pad für 149.-€ bestellt, wir brauchen es als Fernsehersatz in der Küche,<br>ich hoffe dafür wird es nach deiner Einschätzung reichen.\n",
      "Ich meine das Tablet bekomme ich kostenlos da ich mir das Xiaomi 13 T geholt habe kann ich nicht meckern\n",
      "Wenn man das Tab für 50 Euro weniger bekäme, wäre es ein echter Nobrainer. Das ist wie das Fire HD 10 für 80 Euro. Der Preis gibt den Ausschlag. Als Wohnzimmertablet zum Couchsurfen, für Streaming, Social Media und leichte Games ist es doch locker ausreichend. Aber 200 Euro ist mir persönlich dann doch den einen Tacken zuviel. 😁\n",
      "Wir haben das Remi Pad SE mit 6 GB RAM für um die 200 Euro gekauft und ich kann die Aussage zur Leistung so nicht bestätigen. Wir nutzen dieses Tablet bei uns im Bad als Medientablet mit einer Familiensoftware drauf die erkennt wer sich gerade mit welchem Passwort einlockt um dann die entsprechende Oberfläche zu öffnen. Für alle Sozialen Medien, YouTube, Spiele oder auch die ein oder andere Mail reicht das Tablet mehr als aus und mehr muss das Teil auch nicht können. (Für die die jetzt getriggert sind weil wir es als Tablet im Bad nutzen, immer noch besser als Zeitung dabei zu lesen) Tolles Video danke dafür\n",
      "Ich wollte mir erst das SE kaufen, bin dann aber über das normale Redmi Pad (4/128) zum gleichen Preis gestolpert und habe mir das gekauft.<br><br>Vorteile sind das leistungsstärkere SoC (Helio G99, auch in 6nm gefertigt), vor allem im Grafikbereich. Auch der interne Speicher ist schneller, da bekommst du UFS 2.2 Anbindung.<br><br>Mit diesem SoC kann ich auch etwas auffändigere Spiele zocken (Dead Cells, Honkai Star Rail) und die Speicheranbindung ist wesentlich schneller mit Lesen/Schreiben gleichzeitig.<br><br>Ansonsten nehmen sich die beiden Tablets nicht viel; das eine hat einen 3.5mm Klinkenanschluss, das andere hat eine etwas bessere Akkulaufzeit. Aber es sind die oben genannten Vorteile, die für mich die ausschlaggebenden Gründe sind, die für das NON-SE sprechen.\n",
      "Habe das normale Redmi Pad und bin absolut zufrieden.... Nutze es für Streaming und Social Media....Reicht dafür absolut aus ✌️✌️\n",
      "Im Preisbereich bis 200 € gibt es meist nicht viel mehr Leistung, 60 Hz und evtl. LTE, wer mehr möchte , muss auch mehr zahlen 300-400 € ( Xiaomi pad 5 o. 6, Oneplus pad u.a.)\n",
      "Wenn jetzt theoretisch meine Tochter ein neues Tablet gebraucht hätte hätte ich vielleicht mir das mal angeschaut aber für uns Erwachsene würde ich lieber auf xiaomi zurückgreifen\n",
      "Hab am black friday ein originales iPad 9. Generation für 200€ bekommen\n",

I bought a tab S9 fe, within a short time (1 month) it was defective. There was no concert piece and no replacement tablet.

My two-factor authentication phone number on Samsung account is the old one, and I couldn&#39;t pass the initial setup because of that. Spent several days, many hours with Samsung tech support, there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what, against their policy, which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what, ever. So, I couldn&#39;t complete the initial setup and had to return it. Stupidity is on the next level.\n",

      "This Samsung tablet replaced an older Samsung tabS 10\"model. I am a heavy user of my tablets, so I decided to update to this newer model. My older tablet was Amoled, and though this one isn't, I really don't notice the difference. This one is a bit larger, but I also prefer larger screens with my senior vision issues. I play games like Township and Terra Nil, which both work great on this tablet with the extra ram. I mostly have quit using my lap top. As I using this tablet all long, watching utube and Netflix, I decided that I needed to buy a more durable n protective case than the one that originally came with it, just in case I dropped it. Unfortunately, I can no longer use the finger print sensor(it is covered by the new case), and the face recognition doesn't work that well for me. My one change would be for Samsung to add finger print sensor to the screen as an option.\n",

      "The charge holds most of the day for me with all day use, but I will usually put it on the \"fast charger\" after about 6 hrs. I like the battery safety feature that will stop it from over charging, as that may have been a problem with my older tablet.\n",

      "I always used some sort of stylus pens for my tablets, but have never had a tablet that I could actually write/draw on and really didn't think that I needed that feature. But, it has proved very useful once I figured out how to use Samsung notes. I don't think that I would ever buy another tablet without this feature, as I have been able to eliminate most of my paper notes...love using this! I haven't used the pen to draw with, but like to take notes on all my craft projects, etc. I can even insert photos into my notes. My only wish was that I had this when I was in school many years ago, though I would probably have ordered a smaller size for that purpose. This large size is perfect for watching movies and playing games at home. If this tablet lasts as long as my older Samsung, I will be very pleased.\n",

      "This tablet is amazing!! Yes amazing. I was coming from a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 11 inch. And that thing was fast,even in present day. But it got damaged in the field. I use my tablet for business work. Got the S9 FE. I didn't want to buy another flagship (S9 series) because they were more expensive and for my needs the S9 FE served me well.It is still smooth and quick. Not quite as fast as the flagships, but not slow or smooth. Everything that I did on my S7, I am able to do here. Only one issue I have with this tablet is that you can't plug it into an external monitor, which I could before on my S7. But other that that this tablet is amazing and I highly recommend to anyone who wants most of the premium features of the flagship tablets, but don't want to spend the cost for those.\n",
      "This tablet is amazing Yes amazing I was coming from a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 11 inch And that thing was fasteven in present day But it got damaged in the field I use my tablet for business work Got the S9 FE I didnt want to buy another flagship S9 series because they were more expensive and for my needs the S9 FE served me wellIt is still smooth and quick Not quite as fast as the flagships but not slow or smooth Everything that I did on my S7 I am able to do here Only one issue I have with this tablet is that you cant plug it into an external monitor which I could before on my S7 But other that that this tablet is amazing and I highly recommend to anyone who wants most of the premium features of the flagship tablets but dont want to spend the cost for those\n",

      "Update #2 10/30/23\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed one reviewer said they can't stream to their projector with this tablet as it runs slow. One thing I noticed about this tablet, and it is probably more the software is that out of box it appears apps are default set to run in the \"strict power saving\" mode. i accidently noticed this when I had trouble audio streaming via an app. So, I changed the power saving mode to \"optimizzed' and everything worked fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update #1 - 10/19/23.\n",
      "I charged the device from 19% to 85% (Samsung's recommended limit) using the Samsung 45-watt charger. It took 50 minutes. The same charge on my Tab A8 takes about 3.25 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came a day early. The packaging was excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also have a Tab A7 and Tab A8. I purchased the Tab S9 FE 10.9\" to replace the Tab A7 which stopped Android updates with Android 12.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also purchased Samsung's 45-watt charger. The battery was at 51%. I charged it to 91%, I didn't watch the clock so I don't know exactly how long it took but it was quick. I then used Samsung Flow used be Samsung Switch to copy my apps and data from the Tab A8. The Tab S9 came with a cable to I was able to use the wired method for the copying. it went pretty quick.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the apps except two copied. One for some reason is not compatible with the S9. The other I was able to install from Google Play. After that I spent a Few hours organizing my home screen with Microsoft Launcher and signing in and testing my music apps. The audio is okay but when I connected the tablet to one of Sound Core Bluetooth-Speakers I had to turn the volume down to under 25%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The S9 FE is definitely faster than the Tab A8. At one time I had about a half dozen apps open without a problem. The extra .4\" in the display over the A8 is nice. The tablet is definitely bright enough, I am keeping the brightness settings at about 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't tried any games since I don't play them. I did check the download and upload speed and it was basically the same as the Tab A8 which is fine for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the OS goes. It came with Android 13 and Samsung U.I 5.1.1. However, the Android security update was Aug 1st. I imagine it will update soon enough. Google Play was June 2023. It took three restarts to bring it up to September which is a Google issue.\n",

      "That is it for now. I will post an update or two to this once I get more battery and other information.\n",

      "The tablet is amazing. It really charges quickly and holds the charge for an extended period of time. The camera is wonderful. I will use it on any trips that I take.

      "I'm an engineering major and I used this for note-taking. I love the size and weight and the price is a lot more reasonable than an iPad. Great battery life and it never got too hot. Unfortunately, the os is the dealbreaker for me. Comes with a free copy of Goodnotes pro but the android version is slow, glitchy and has way less features than the iOS version. There are way fewer apps available for Android and the ones that are available are pretty clunky; samsung notes has a lot of great features but is missing some major ones, i.e. page layout and font customization. Maybe in a few years Android will catch up, but as of now the Android app experience just can't compete with iOS.\n",

      "I love the fact i can run any two apps in multi-window mode with ease, including ones otherwise memory hogging, lol. I cannot say enough good about this tablet, dont know what to say so i will state my only gripe: It wont connect to wifi 5g speeds. Meaning I have a 500mbs connection but never get more than 350mbs on the tablet two feet from the router. On my computer 3 rooms away, i get 450-525mbs. Why is this??? It may be the norm for tablets and phones, not sure. I definately recommend this tablet especially for multitasking.\n",

      "I was so excited to try this tablet for my art, as Android has a ton of things that make for an efficient workflow including air gestures (with the S-Pen Pro, not included), air actions, DEX mode, syncing with my Windows computer, and so much more. The mint color is gorgeous, and I loved everything about the tablet... except that it couldn't do the ONE thing I bought it to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "It worked fine at first, but then I noticed there was an extreme delay in gestures when switching from pen to gesture, and sometimes just wouldn't work at all. This happened in my Clip Studio app as well as others. I spent hours with support for the tablet and with CSP before being forced to factory reset, which somehow solved it... Until I installed the updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turns out, the issue is with OneUI, and hasn't been resolved for years according to the complaints on Reddit dating back to 2022. This delay completely interrupts my workflow, as I can not seamlessly switch from drawing with the pen, to zooming or rotating with my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had returned the first tablet I got, under the direction of the support desk, only to get a second one, spend hours re-installing my brushes on CSP, only to find the same problem. It's definitely an issue with OneUI.\n",
      "\n",
      "For everyone else who doesn't care, or who doesn't intend to use it for art, it's 100% fantastic. Bright screen, powerful budget tablet that can do so much more than you think it can.\n",
      "\n",
      "For artists? I am so sad to claim defeat to the iPad which can do the one thing this one can not: Work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The straw that broke the camel's back for me is more of an issue with Clip Studio Paint's Android version which does not allow you to access your files in ANY other way except through the cloud, making it absolutely impossible to batch move your files from your tablet's CSP to your desktop, external HD, or other devices. You literally have to manually open each file from the cloud, onto desktop, then save it where you want. Or you have to access the files ONE at a time through the cloud, click an arrow, open the file location, cut the file and paste it where you want. And of course the file location doesn't have ALL your images in one place. it places it within 3 tiers of foldiers for each. individual. file.\n",
      "\n",
      "So after going through 2 tablets, hours of support, blood sweat and tears, I finally have to call it quits on the Samsung Tablet yet again and switch to the 2x more expensive iPad. I'm so devastated.\n",

      "Too soon to say anything about battery life, or value, or durability. Stupid things to aske me to rate after owing it for less than a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "All I can say is that it works and the Samsung feature to transfer apps and data from an older tablet also worked. I did have to spend maybe 4 hour on the line with Samsung tech support due to their Catch-22 2 factor authentication. It seems that if you don't have a textable smart phone (and I don't) you can only do the REQUIRED 2-factor authentication via pre-generated PINS. BUT .... you can only generate the PINS if you have already passed 2-factor authentication, which needs a smart phone. Are you with me? They do not offer sending a voice message with the secret one-time use PIN to a phone. Noooooo. Only text messaging will do. This is absurd and exceptionally inconvenient. Grrr to Samsung.\n",

      "Love the tablet. Perfect for a digital artist. Screen is sensitive for the S pen, so perfect for drawing. Not many updates during shipping so hard to know where it was or when to be around to sign for it. Delivery lady was on time and friendly once the delivery time actually updated. Tablet DID NOT come with the \"book cover\" case that was listed in \"included compenents\" in the ad. They couldn't do anything about it unless I sent the whole thing back and couldn't just send me the book cover or a small credit to turn around and buy my own. Disappointed with that. Good tablet though.\n",

      "I needed a new tablet since my other one had a UI System notification come up. The system was going out after 4 years. This tablet is fast and battery life on it lasts. I play games, music, videos, run cameras, and take credit card payments on it throughout each day. Like any other device, the more you use it, the more the battery drains. I'm usually on it full force for 6 to 7 hours before it let's me know my battery is at 15%.

      "I bought this to my son to replace a Samsung tablet from 2017 that was struggling pretty hard with games like roblox and minecraft. I have to say that I'm very impressed with this tablet even considering it doesn't have a Snapdragon on it! Everything we have thrown at it has worked without any problems, without lowering the gaming experience and or performance. The speakers are also very good for what the tablet costs. I have an iPad Pro M1 and honestly, I found the volume and sound quality to be on par or very close to the iPad. The screen is crispy and smooth, with good definition, contrast and clarity. Very happy with this tablet and needless to say, my son is very very pleased with it.\n",

That said, an SD slot is far more convenient, be it  a lot slower than an SSD drive.    At this point, we had SSD drives that are pretty darn small and can be attached right to the back of a device offering 1, 2 or even 4 TB&#39;s of storage dirt cheap.  The world of tablets continues to get better.   Start with apps you want.  Android is useless if your favorite app isn&#39;t supported!   Sadly, many great apps are still iOs only.   :(   Just keep it in mind.\n",

      "For me, the fact that it has a micro SD card slot is very important. Because I can have several micro sd cards to view my photos taken with my Canon R6 II. And I like the freedom of Android and the 14.6” screen size. And I paid $1,200 for the 512Gb Tab S9 Ultra + Keyboard Cover and S Pen. All in the same package. If it were on the iPad, it would cost around $2,500 here in Brazil. And on the Samsung Brazil website, I am paying $1,200 in 12 installments of $100 per month. 😄.

      "I just got this Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 11 inch model. I ordered an IPAD 5th generation from Amazon to see which I would like. The Tab A9+ 11-inch model appears to be a clear winner. I previously had an 8-inch Galaxy Tab7 lite which was about 8 inches. This new Tabsa9 plus is 11 inches, so about 1.5 inches longer and wider. For ereaders (I use LIBBY) it is a bit big, but slender and can still fit on the top of treadmill ledges and is a decent size for airplane travel. The new tablet is super light so hardly any weight difference. Screen is super bright and the computing power is fast. I’m a mac/apple user, but found that it seems to be seamlessly and quickly connecting to my iphone 15. I ordered an electronic pen for writing notes, and the size of this seems perfect for it. I also ordered a glass screen protector and a case, both were cheap. This tab device is fantastic in that you can easily buy and load additional storage space. It is a Ferrari of an ereader, but with the electronic pen writing capacity plus colorful screen, and fast computing power, it works great as a notebook style computer. Really, for the money (it retails for $219) it is a fantastic buy. The ipads from Apple were all 3-5 times the price. To get an ipad for this price I needed to go to an old, who-knows how long it will work, 2017 model ipad. No question, this is a wonderful product by Samsung, and I’m speaking as a fan of Apple. I totally recommend this tablet at this time at least. Once I start really using it If I have any dissatisfactions I’ll post an edited review.\n",

      "I've had this tablet for about a day and put it through it's paces with all the streaming apps that I use - except one that won't work with the tablet because it hasn't been updated by the service - and it worked wonderfully for all of them. The Full-HD capable screen is bright and punchy, while the speakers are crisp and clear with or without the Dolby Atmos sound enhancement turned on. As far as gaming goes, it's not a gaming tablet by any means, but it will play most older Android titles fairly well, particularly the puzzle games or JRPG ports from various companies like Kemco and Square-Enix. The one and only area in which this tablet falls short in all metrics is the WiFi, as Samsung chose to use a cheap WiFi chip that only has a single connection - that means no MIMO WiFi - and it tops out at 433Mbps, which means it's WiFi is sub-par and does not pair well with the speedy CPU and RAM that would give super-fast download speeds and a stronger WiFi connection with a 2x2 WiFi design. Apart from that, the tablet is almost perfect, though some may find Samsung's latest One UI to be clunky and awkward to use, as it has some quirky design flaws that detract from usability in comparison to regular Android tablets that use Google's own interface.\n",

The camera sticks out a good amount so if you plan to not use a case be aware of that.

The tablet is quick and snappy with loading and navigating which is probably due it it's Qualcomm processor, I've found myself frustrated many times trying to use slow and sluggish budget devices so I'm very satisfied with the experience here. The 1080p picture on the lcd display isn't anything amazing but for a budget device it gets by, I love the smooth 90hz capability as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "However I don't love that out of box my unit suffers from a dead pixel on the lcd but fortunately it's so small that it's barely noticeable. It's not a deal breaker for me I just expect better quality control from Samsung.\n",

      "Surprisingly a major positive is the sound quality. I found myself ditching the earbuds a lot with this tablet. The sound is loud and clear with it's four speakers! Very surprising for a budget device.\n",

      "Overall I'd recommend this tablet to anyone wants an affordable and capable device either for work or leasure. I haven’t tried gaming on it but I'm sure it would handle itself pretty well. A great value but If this tablet goes on sale than it's pretty much a no brainer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Annoyingly this tablet doesn't a include a USB-C charging brick. I had to use my phone charger instead because the included charging cable was USB-C to USB-C. I only own USB-A bricks. So be prepared.\n",

      "I love the tablet, however, the one I ordered from Amazon I had to return. It was advertised as being the 5g model. When I took it to my internet provider, it did not have the correct chip holder for wifi operation! I ended up getting the same tablet, but with the correct chip card holder, from my provider and returning the one to Amazon. I wanted the new Samsung tablet especially for its 5g capabilities. I figured out later, that was probably why the Amazon one was a lot less in price. Still a wonderful tablet! And, Amazon readily took back the original one.\n",

      "I upgraded from a Galaxy A8 and loving this tablet, except for the current software bug effecting these A9 models. There is an issue with the multi-point touch such as when pinch zooming or playing a game that involves 2 fingers touching at the same time. It is very glitchy. You kinda have to finesse the pinch zoom with a light touch and it will work. If you don't play games and aren't constantly using the pinch zoom function which most probably aren't, you will hardly notice the issue. Though if you play games involving multi-touch, this will be a problem for you. Strangely though, if you plug corded headphones into the jack, the problem stops, really weird. It does seem to just be a software bug though and Samsung should be able to fix the problem with an update patch. Unfortunately little problems like this are just part of the technological world we live in now and occasionally happens to the devices we use and they need to be updated. Other than that though... This tablet feels nice and light, runs fast and smooth with the upgraded processor and increased 8GB of RAM on the A9+ model, and the screen has a beautiful bright picture with nice deep and vibrant colors. I did a side by side HD video comparison with my A8 and the picture on the A9 is quite a noticeable improvement. And I see people saying that there's didn't come with a charger as if it's a mistake. It is not a mistake, Samsung doesn't send chargers with their products anymore. They say it's to minimize their impact on the environment or whatever, and also because I think they know most people have plenty of charging blocks and USB C cables laying around at this point being that so many products use them now, and if you don't you can buy one very cheap. With all that said, if you can deal with the current multi-touch problem until it's fixed, I highly recommend getting this tablet as everything else about it is great!\n",

      "My 2017 8\" A8 is getting long in the tooth. I've had some software incompatibility show up. Android 9 doesn't cut it anymore. The battery is also starting to lose charge a bit. The A9+ has Android 14 and a new battery, so those issues are gone. Everything seems to work according to Samsung's usual high standards. People in reviews seem to complain about slow charging. It's 2024 folks. My fast chargers have no problem charging it up in a few hours.\n",

I got the \"HXCASEAC Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+/ A9 Plus Case 11 Inch\", and it is also the second time I've bought this case. Protective rubber, and a built in screen protector. Shamefully I was upgrading from a Tab 7, and probably wouldn't have done that if the batteries hadn't swollen and gotten hot. But back to this tablet. If you've had a Tab before, worry not, here things just got better. The colors, the feels, it's all there. I purchased a 1TB MicroSD card and it has a home in this Tab 9+. Beyond that I'm not sure what I can say about this Tab, oh yeah, it's from Samsung so it's full of Samsung goodness.\n",

I love that this has a 128 GB of storage. Cause I can have any app that I have Heart set on and I don't have to worry about anything going over. Or having backup storage. You can also use a microSD card with it. I have not needed to but I do own one if that is ever needed. Overall.

      "I bought this to use as an inexpensive tablet I could use while backpacking. I was looking for something really basic that I could read at camp, check maps, and listen to music offline while hiking. Being a Samsung, it meant I would be able to find a decent case for it to provide at least some basic protection. If it got damaged during the hike, well... it was a cheap tablet so it should be good enough.\n",

      "It had 55% battery when it arrived, so I plugged it into a USB-C cable I had plugged into the USB port on my wall outlet. I figured this would be alright since it would need to be charged from a portable power source in the field anyway. After 48 minutes, it managed to charge only to 64%! I wanted to err on it being my cable, so I plugged it into a USB-C power brick instead and put that in my outlet. My wall outlets are 20w, and this requires 15w to charge, so it should totally work.\n",

      "It managed to hit 100% 4.5 hours later. Taking four and a half hours to charge anything 36% is insane. When I finally was able to power the tablet on, the screen was so dim, I could barely see anything. After rushing through the typical Android setup, I managed to increase the display brightness to around 50%. After installing 3 apps, I noticed that the battery was at 93% for less than a half hour of use.\n",

I bought/returned about 3 samsungs before I found a good one and I didn't want a phone version just because it would have been too small without the TV. So this worked.

My two-factor authentication phone number on Samsung account is the old one, and I couldn&#39;t pass the initial setup because of that. Spent several days, many hours with Samsung tech support, there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what, against their policy, which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what, ever.

That said, an SD slot is far more convenient, be it  a lot slower than an SSD drive.    At this point, we had SSD drives that are pretty darn small and can be attached right to the back of a device offering 1, 2 or even 4 TB&#39;s of storage dirt cheap.  The world of tablets continues to get better.   Start with apps you want.  Android is useless if your favorite app isn&#39;t supported!   Sadly, many great apps are still iOs only.   :(   Just keep it in mind.\n",

      "I just got this Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 11 inch model. I ordered an IPAD 5th generation from Amazon to see which I would like. The Tab A9+ 11-inch model appears to be a clear winner. I previously had an 8-inch Galaxy Tab7 lite which was about 8 inches. This new Tabsa9 plus is 11 inches, so about 1.5 inches longer and wider. For ereaders (I use LIBBY) it is a bit big, but slender and can still fit on the top of treadmill ledges and is a decent size for airplane travel. The new tablet is super light so hardly any weight difference. Screen is super bright and the computing power is fast. I’m a mac/apple user, but found that it seems to be seamlessly and quickly connecting to my iphone 15. I ordered an electronic pen for writing notes, and the size of this seems perfect for it. I also ordered a glass screen protector and a case, both were cheap. This tab device is fantastic in that you can easily buy and load additional storage space. It is a Ferrari of an ereader, but with the electronic pen writing capacity plus colorful screen, and fast computing power, it works great as a notebook style computer. Really, for the money (it retails for $219) it is a fantastic buy. The ipads from Apple were all 3-5 times the price. To get an ipad for this price I needed to go to an old, who-knows how long it will work, 2017 model ipad. No question, this is a wonderful product by Samsung, and I’m speaking as a fan of Apple. I totally recommend this tablet at this time at least. Once I start really using it If I have any dissatisfactions I’ll post an edited review.\n",

      "I've had this tablet for about a day and put it through it's paces with all the streaming apps that I use - except one that won't work with the tablet because it hasn't been updated by the service - and it worked wonderfully for all of them. The Full-HD capable screen is bright and punchy, while the speakers are crisp and clear with or without the Dolby Atmos sound enhancement turned on. As far as gaming goes, it's not a gaming tablet by any means, but it will play most older Android titles fairly well, particularly the puzzle games or JRPG ports from various companies like Kemco and Square-Enix. The one and only area in which this tablet falls short in all metrics is the WiFi, as Samsung chose to use a cheap WiFi chip that only has a single connection - that means no MIMO WiFi - and it tops out at 433Mbps, which means it's WiFi is sub-par and does not pair well with the speedy CPU and RAM that would give super-fast download speeds and a stronger WiFi connection with a 2x2 WiFi design. Apart from that, the tablet is almost perfect, though some may find Samsung's latest One UI to be clunky and awkward to use, as it has some quirky design flaws that detract from usability in comparison to regular Android tablets that use Google's own interface.\n",

The camera sticks out a good amount so if you plan to not use a case be aware of that.

Expandable storage is really nice and it seamlessly captured the data from my current samsung device.\n",

When I took it to my internet provider, it did not have the correct chip holder for wifi operation! I ended up getting the same tablet, but with the correct chip card holder, from my provider and returning the one to Amazon. I wanted the new Samsung tablet especially for its 5g capabilities. I figured out later, that was probably why the Amazon one was a lot less in price. Still a wonderful tablet! And, Amazon readily took back the original one.\n",

      "I upgraded from a Galaxy A8 and loving this tablet, except for the current software bug effecting these A9 models. There is an issue with the multi-point touch such as when pinch zooming or playing a game that involves 2 fingers touching at the same time. It is very glitchy. You kinda have to finesse the pinch zoom with a light touch and it will work. If you don't play games and aren't constantly using the pinch zoom function which most probably aren't, you will hardly notice the issue. Though if you play games involving multi-touch, this will be a problem for you. Strangely though, if you plug corded headphones into the jack, the problem stops, really weird. It does seem to just be a software bug though and Samsung should be able to fix the problem with an update patch. Unfortunately little problems like this are just part of the technological world we live in now and occasionally happens to the devices we use and they need to be updated. Other than that though... This tablet feels nice and light, runs fast and smooth with the upgraded processor and increased 8GB of RAM on the A9+ model, and the screen has a beautiful bright picture with nice deep and vibrant colors. I did a side by side HD video comparison with my A8 and the picture on the A9 is quite a noticeable improvement. And I see people saying that there's didn't come with a charger as if it's a mistake. It is not a mistake, Samsung doesn't send chargers with their products anymore. They say it's to minimize their impact on the environment or whatever, and also because I think they know most people have plenty of charging blocks and USB C cables laying around at this point being that so many products use them now, and if you don't you can buy one very cheap. With all that said, if you can deal with the current multi-touch problem until it's fixed, I highly recommend getting this tablet as everything else about it is great!\n",

Shamefully I was upgrading from a Tab 7, and probably wouldn't have done that if the batteries hadn't swollen and gotten hot. But back to this tablet. If you've had a Tab before, worry not, here things just got better. The colors, the feels, it's all there. I purchased a 1TB MicroSD card and it has a home in this Tab 9+. Beyond that I'm not sure what I can say about this Tab, oh yeah, it's from Samsung so it's full of Samsung goodness.\n",

      "At first I was hesitant, because being a tablet I always doubt if it will be good or not, or if it will be fast. But I must confess that this tablet has surprised me.

      "I use my tablet constantly for playing games, having virtual Doctor's appointments, online shopping and online banking. It is very fast, fastest I've ever had actually, and it is so easy to use. I absolutely love how thin it is and lightweight. Because a lot of them are super heavy for what they are. I love that this has a 128 GB of storage. Cause I can have any app that I have Heart set on and I don't have to worry about anything going over. Or having backup storage. You can also use a microSD card with it. I have not needed to but I do own one if that is ever needed. Overall. This is the best tablet I've ever owned and I've owned a lot of different tablets over the years. I love this more than my previous iPad. And my previous Kindle HD 10 highly recommended. 10 out of 10\n",

      "I bought this to use as an inexpensive tablet I could use while backpacking. I was looking for something really basic that I could read at camp, check maps, and listen to music offline while hiking. Being a Samsung, it meant I would be able to find a decent case for it to provide at least some basic protection. If it got damaged during the hike, well... it was a cheap tablet so it should be good enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had 55% battery when it arrived, so I plugged it into a USB-C cable I had plugged into the USB port on my wall outlet. I figured this would be alright since it would need to be charged from a portable power source in the field anyway. After 48 minutes, it managed to charge only to 64%! I wanted to err on it being my cable, so I plugged it into a USB-C power brick instead and put that in my outlet. My wall outlets are 20w, and this requires 15w to charge, so it should totally work.\n",
      "\n",
      "It managed to hit 100% 4.5 hours later. Taking four and a half hours to charge anything 36% is insane. When I finally was able to power the tablet on, the screen was so dim, I could barely see anything. After rushing through the typical Android setup, I managed to increase the display brightness to around 50%. After installing 3 apps, I noticed that the battery was at 93% for less than a half hour of use.\n",

      "I definitely do not recommend this tablet. The cons far outweigh the pros in this device, especially since finding a budget tablet is not really that hard to find these days.\n",

The screen is several inches bigger than my S6 Lite but it's not too big. The only thing I didn't like was that it didn't come with the S Pen (which I know it didn't) but bought some capacitive stylus' and problem solved. Overall I am very happy with this tablet. I will always stick to Samsung for phones, air buds, and tablets as they are hard to beat!\n",

I have had the tablet for a week and have no speed or input issues, and visually the tablet itself is sleek. I am using for work and have had no productivity issues sharing service and apps between my ZFold 3. I recommend purchase, I shopped around for two months and am happy with my choice. Will provide update in 6 months but anticipate no issues. Battery lasts roughly 32 hours on full charge with mid to full use each day. I am happy with that. Fast charging is complete in 1.5 hour's from 5%. Regardless, research anyway and make the best choice for you.\n",

It's great for Netflix and YouTube or anything else like that. You don't get 4K with this tablet but 1080 is more than good enough. You get great audio and the battery life is exceptional. On a full charge you get 2 days of use and thats with me heavily using it. I recommend getting the 128 gb version of this tablet given its a tremendous value. If you are use to using a laptop or a PC this tablet comes equipped with Samsung Dex which gives you that same look and feel so that's a big plus. Overall it's a really good tablet for the price that comes with a lot of bells and whistles you see with a expensive tablet. I highly recommend!\n",

I looked for the version with 8GB of RAM so it would be faster. One piece of information that I find useful and that I hadn't seen before is that it has a split screen function, so I can use YouTube and a writing app or other content at the same time (I even added an image). This makes it much easier for those who like to take notes. The sound on this tablet is wonderful, due to the four outputs and the screen also surprised me with its quality! I made an excellent purchase. Furthermore, upon arriving in Brazil it was taxed and the seller promptly paid the fee very quickly.\n",

I can buy Samsung Galaxy Tab S9FE for $340 USD or Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 for $560 USD. I expect to keep this tablet around 3 years, will likely trade up after that.

I need spill protection as I’m a klutz 😂. Which tablet do you recommend for me?\n",

it I need it for streaming browsing the web and listening to music and podcasts I got a Pixel 8 Pro as my mobile phone So as you can tell strong processors doesnt matter much to me I dont play games

for anyone thinking about buying these Samsung tablets THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY Are good Yes But if it fails youll be ruined I bought a tab S9 fe within a short time 1 month it was defective There was no concert piece and no replacement tablet In this case Im still waiting for Samsungs goodwill What worries me is the following a newly manufactured tablet that no longer has spare parts What if it fails when it is no longer under warranty How is the consumer >>><<< I have one of these and Im very happy >>><<< Is it good for reading >>><<< good video but I could show if he transitions between cameras during recording now how do I know no channel shows that >>><<< When I was going to ask if I could use my Xiaomi charging base which is 33watts he answered my question >>><<< 5 volts

better charger >>><<< Correction the s9 FE does not have video output via USB C to connect an external monitor >>><<< Samsung Galaxy Tablet galaxytabS9 >>><<< Does it come with a Spen pen >>><<< Now that the S6 lite is being discontinued does it become a good replacement Genuine question I want to know which one to buy since the S6 is coming out >>><<< I bought and returned S7 just recently The reason is ridiculous Samsung integrated a Samsung account into it and if you cant sign in into your Samsung account you cant pass the initial setup process which means you cannot use the tablet My twofactor authentication phone number on Samsung account is the old one and I couldnt pass the initial setup because of that Spent several days many hours with Samsung tech support there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what against their policy which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what ever So I couldnt complete the initial setup and had to return it Stupidity is on the next level >>><<< going Android is too much sacrifice lol >>><<< Have you heard of the xiaomi pad 6 max tablet 14 I wish you could do a review on that >>><<< iPad has been long dead Apple killed it >>><<< Hey people Stop bringing some other Android samples as ipad killer whatever This one got OLED display USB32 GEN1x1 Fantastic pen Best optimized for Android

chance >>><<< 621 the audio and video gets out of sync Stretching it till 654 and still same >>><<< Ipad killer is the people who make ipad app When the apps worth having are non existent in play store The term Ipad killer is just a joke I hate getting trapped in the walled garden but there is no choice >>><<< no foce ReusRe anda roses no nmor dr >>><<< I use now >>><<< Isnt the iPad killer and Samsung killer titles are super old click baits Everyone knows by now if you are an apple user you will get an iPad if you use Android you will get anything android starting with Samsung >>><<< I think people to for biggerscreebmn because bigger is more usable I like the form factor of smaller phones and devcies but really typing on tiny things kind of sucks >>><<< It cant be an ipad killer Actually all android pads features and powers are wasted What makes ipad good is its app store You can make the most of the iPads abilities because you have adobe apps Microsoft affinity photo and alot of good pdf reading apps like notability but android So what we actually need is more support from google i guess >>><<< how curious here in brazil a s9 ultra is way cheaper than an ipad pro I wonder why >>><<< I want that tablet >>><<< The tablet acrobat of juggernauts in the flat in you hand world is the s tab series razor thin and sharp strong connection is a phenomenal tablet when I say phenomenal I mean exquisite I Boasted over these tablets last year so I know this tablet is better but I might not get to experience it because there might be a Ten before I can get my hands on one so yes I agree that tablet does damage to the iPad but wait for ios and soc capability is pretty impressive due to the fact it will lock you out of the dawm device for a month and once you get it unlocked its like it was never locked I really cant say the same thing for Samsung s tab Because we know once its gone thats it so who cares its multitasking and customizability knocks that apple out of the tree also the UNIX lossy storage is very useful in certain use cases then you have expandable storage of s tab you just cant beat it thats it >>><<< Whats up everyone I hope this complete Tab

display out via USB c The Fe >>><<< Are these tablets suitable for Animation otherwise please suggest a tablet that is suitable for running animation software Thank you >>><<< does samsung tablet s9 normal support external display With windows 10 >>><<< This Samsung tablet replaced an older Samsung tabS 10model I am a heavy user of my tablets so I decided to update to this newer model My older tablet was Amoled and though this one isnt I really dont notice the difference This one is a bit larger but I also prefer larger screens with my senior vision issues I play games like Township and Terra Nil which both work great on this tablet with the extra ram I mostly have quit using my lap top As I using this tablet all long watching utube and Netflix I decided that I needed to buy a more durable n protective case than the one that originally came with it just in case I dropped it Unfortunately I can no longer use the finger print sensorit is covered by the new case and the face recognition doesnt work that well for me My one change would be for Samsung to add finger print sensor to the screen as an option The charge holds most of the day for me with all day use but I will usually put it on the fast charger after about 6 hrs I like the battery safety feature that will stop it from over charging as that may have been a problem with my older tablet I always used some sort of stylus pens for my tablets but have never had a tablet that I could actually writedraw on and really didnt think that I needed that feature But it has proved very useful once I figured out how to use Samsung notes I dont think that I would ever buy another tablet without this feature as I have been able to eliminate most of my paper noteslove using this I havent used the pen to draw with but like to take notes on all my craft projects etc I can even insert photos into my notes My only wish was that I had this when I was in school many years ago though I would probably have ordered a smaller size for that purpose This large size is perfect for watching movie >>><<< This tablet is amazing Yes amazing I was coming from a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 11 inch And that thing was fasteven in present day But it got damaged in the field I use my tablet for business work Got the S9 FE I didnt want to buy another flagship S9 series because they were more expensive and for my needs the S9 FE served me wellIt is still smooth and quick Not quite as fast as the flagships but not slow or smooth Everything that I did on my S7 I am able to do here Only one issue I have with this tablet is that you cant plug it into an external monitor which I could before on my S7 But other that that this tablet is amazing and I highly recommend to anyone who wants most of the premium features of the flagship tablets but dont want to spend the cost for those >>><<< Updates will be posted on the top Update 3 120723 My FE just got Android 14 with UI 60 Quick download and install no problems Update 2 103023 I noticed one reviewer said they cant stream to their projector with this tablet as it runs slow One thing I noticed about this tablet and it is probably more the software is that out of box it appears apps are default set to run in the strict power saving mode i accidently noticed this when I had trouble audio streaming via an app So I changed the power saving mode to optimizzed and everything worked fine Update 1 101923 I charged the device from 19percent to 85percent Samsungs recommended limit using the Samsung 45watt charger It took 50 minutes The same charge on my Tab A8 takes about 325 hours It came a day early The packaging was excellent I also have a Tab A7 and Tab A8 I purchased the Tab S9 FE 109 to replace the Tab A7 which stopped Android updates with Android 12 I also purchased Samsungs 45watt charger The battery was at 51percent I charged it to 91percent I didnt watch the clock so I dont know exactly how long it took but it was quick I then used Samsung Flow used be Samsung Switch to copy my apps and data from the Tab A8 The Tab S9 came with a cable to I was able to use the wired method for the copying it went pretty quick All the apps except two copied One for some reason is not compatible with the S9 The other I was able to install from Google Play After that I spent a Few hours organizing my home screen with Microsoft Launcher and signing in and testing my music apps The audio is okay but when I connected the tablet to one of Sound Core BluetoothSpeakers I had to turn the volume down to under 25percent The S9 FE is definitely faster than the Tab A8 At one time I had about a half dozen apps open without a problem The >>><<< The tablet is amazing It really charges quickly and holds the charge for an extended period of time The camera is wonderful I will use it on any trips that I take I got a zipped covering for it with a strap I want to use it esp for panoramic pictures that will be in the making Highly recommend >>><<< Im an engineering major and I used this for notetaking I love the size and weight and the price is a lot more reasonable than an iPad Great battery life and it never got too hot Unfortunately the os is the dealbreaker for me Comes with a free copy of Goodnotes pro but the android version is slow glitchy and has way less features than the iOS version There are way fewer apps available for Android and the ones that are available are pretty clunky samsung notes has a lot of great features but is missing some major ones ie page layout and font customization Maybe in a few years Android will catch up but as of now the Android app experience just cant compete with iOS >>><<< The tablet is slightly larger than my previous one but quite a bit heavier probably the larger battery Nice screen Performance is good Very pleased with my purchase >>><<< Great for drawing watching movies ECT sounds decent love the operating system Screen shows very clear I Just put sim card in it an it activated its self Very thin pen is decent size not skinny I LOVE IT >>><<< I love the fact i can run any two apps in multiwindow mode with ease including ones otherwise memory hogging lol I cannot say enough good about this tablet dont know what to say so i will state my only gripe It wont connect to wifi 5g speeds Meaning I have a 500mbs connection but never get more than 350mbs on the tablet two feet from the router On my computer 3 rooms away i get 450525mbs Why is this It may be the norm for tablets and phones not sure I definately recommend this tablet especially for multitasking >>><<< I was so excited to try this tablet for my art as Android has a ton of things that make for an efficient workflow including air gestures with the SPen Pro not included air actions DEX mode syncing with my Windows computer and so much more The mint color is gorgeous and I loved everything about the tablet except that it couldnt do the ONE thing I bought it to do It worked fine at first but then I noticed there was an extreme delay in gestures when switching from pen to gesture and sometimes just wouldnt work at all This happened in my Clip Studio app as well as others I spent hours with support for the tablet and with CSP before being forced to factory reset which somehow solved it Until I installed the updates Turns out the issue is with OneUI and hasnt been resolved for years according to the complaints on Reddit dating back to 2022 This delay completely interrupts my workflow as I can not seamlessly switch from drawing with the pen to zooming or rotating with my hand I had returned the first tablet I got under the direction of the support desk only to get a second one spend hours reinstalling my brushes on CSP only to find the same problem Its definitely an issue with OneUI For everyone else who doesnt care or who doesnt intend to use it for art its 100percent fantastic Bright screen powerful budget tablet that can do so much more than you think it can For artists I am so sad to claim defeat to the iPad which can do the one thing this one can not Work The straw that broke the camels back for me is more of an issue with Clip Studio Paints Android version which does not allow you to access your files in ANY other way except through the cloud making it absolutely impossible to batch move your files from your tablets CSP to your desktop external HD or other devices You li >>><<< Too soon to say anything about battery life or value or durability Stupid things to aske me to rate after owing it for less than a week All I can say is that it works and the Samsung feature to transfer apps and data from an older tablet also worked I did have to spend maybe 4 hour on the line with Samsung tech support due to their Catch22 2 factor authentication It seems that if you dont have a textable smart phone and I dont you can only do the REQUIRED 2factor authentication via pregenerated PINS BUT you can only generate the PINS if you have already passed 2factor authentication which needs a smart phone Are you with me They do not offer sending a voice message with the secret onetime use PIN to a phone Noooooo Only text messaging will do This is absurd and exceptionally inconvenient Grrr to Samsung >>><<< Bought refurbished version but it was still pretty good A nice step up from the junky tablets under dollar200 Will say that I expected it to have a SIM card slot since its supposed to be 5G capable but the card insert didnt have a place for it Its also pretty good for digital art drawing with the Samsung pen with great response time though I have not tested it with anything else Used Ibis paint app with it Would highly recommend a case that holds the pen securely as it can be easy to lose or damage it and I doubt the Spen is cheap to replace All in all seems like a solid tablet and ya wont break the bank like ya would with an iPad >>><<< I owned a Tab A7 for a couple of years and the battery started expanding pushing the screen outwards Time to purchase a new tablet before it started a fire Decided on the Samsung Tab S9 FE and have not regretted it So much faster and a much bigger screen with a vivid display Only drawback is its a bit on the heavy side >>><<< It is a very good option I have been using it for 3 months work student and personal it is an excellent tablet it does not lock it runs almost everything my only complaint is that in the description it indicated that it came with the protector and that is a lie the tablet only comes for a few days I used it without a protector but it is better with its protector it gives security and the original comes with the pencil protector which is brilliant >>><<< Love the tablet Perfect for a digital artist Screen is sensitive for the S pen so perfect for drawing Not many updates during shipping so hard to know where it was or when to be around to sign for it Delivery lady was on time and friendly once the delivery time actually updated Tablet DID NOT come with the book cover case that was listed in included compenents in the ad They couldnt do anything about it unless I sent the whole thing back and couldnt just send me the book cover or a small credit to turn around and buy my own Disappointed with that Good tablet though >>><<< Samsung makes great products and this is one however I needed to return it because I got one that better suited my needs When I returned it I had to pay dollar2 for a label then they also subtracted dollar1250 for shupping from my return >>><<< Got the item it was well packaged to get out very nice product so far happy just trying to figure out the insurance that Im the extra insurance that I bought to cover it thats all >>><<< Arrived early was fine packaged correctly everything has worked as it should no problems at all >>><<< This is a great tablet but I needed it for a small business start up and not for everything I needed it for I was having issues with everything i loaded on it It might not have been the tablet just me >>><<< I loved the tablet it works quickly it is useful for what I need but my only complaint is that it does not work to project to HDMI which is terrible Im a teacher and I thought I could use it to present in class but that wasnt the case >>><<< I have received the tablet today and it just looks beautiful and perfectly for a student I will definitely recommend >>><<< I liked it because my daughter a medical student makes it easier for her to study consult entertain and communicate >>><<< Big improvement from my Fire HD 10 Fast and I really like the compatibility with my phone and laptop >>><<< I purchased 2 of these for my wife and I We used them on a LONG flight to New Zealand from Texas We was about to download a lot of shows to watch and never had to charge them from start to finish 16 hours flight >>><<< This tablet is everything I was looking for It is resistant fast the touch is fantastic the screen has excellent resolution the functions with the pen are the best and the response is fast there is no delay It met all expectations >>><<< Im loving my new tablet It was easy to setup and use >>><<< Performance So far its been able to handle anything I do without many problems Im able to use large 4000px canvas sizes on multiple drawing apps wo any lag or crashing Simple editing on 4k videos also isnt a problem But weirdly the one thing it struggles on is screen mirroring Itll disconnect or even out right crash sometimes it happens often enough that Ive stopped using it completely Battery I only charge up to 85percent and I still spend 10 hours drawing with music on in the background without power saving on The charging is also pretty fast Other I wish the s pen was more comfortable drawing or writing with it is painful for long periods it needs a grip The oem nib is ok but a textured screen protector metal nib feels necessary for drawingwriting >>><<< Hello this review is to mention that I am very happy with the product but as I understood the cover came in the purchase but in the box there was no gift cover luckily I came up with the idea of adding a separate generic cover but it is wrong that the product that includes the cover appears in the images when it is not >>><<< Im a teacher and was looking for something good and inexpensive to use to write on PDF of assignments and test It is simply amazing I love it the SPen is amazing and the Battery Life too Drawing is one of my hobbies so its also really awesome at that too >>><<< Its a very nice tablet I am really enjoying using it >>><<< Perfect function and nice image >>><<< Will be getting one for my daughter >>><<< Very satisfied I loved it >>><<< I bought this to be used as a digital planner I didnt need the fancy stuff and I thought it was too big for my needs as a teacher I decided to go with the smaller version the 109 because of the price as well If you are using this for gaming than this is for you Otherwise the smaller one does what I needed and I am happy that I returned this for the smaller version >>><<< I needed a new tablet since my other one had a UI System notification come up The system was going out after 4 years This tablet is fast and battery life on it lasts I play games music videos run cameras and take credit card payments on it throughout each day Like any other device the more you use it the more the battery drains Im usually on it full force for 6 to 7 hours before it lets me know my battery is at 15percent Im at 5059 at clearing my apps when I switch from one to the other I keep a charger next to me all day and I could get more out of the battery if I was more picky about it The pen works very well too Ive noticed I use the pen more on this tablet than any other tablet Ive had prior I got the 256gb on this one and surprisingly enough I havent had to delete stuff to make more room If it had calling and texting on it permanently I would be on the tablet more than my phone I mainly use it on the homes wifi so no need to spend an extra dollar27 for service on the tablet If I need wifi connected on this tablet I just connect it to my cell phone All our phones have unlimited everything so it pays to use it >>><<< Im sure the battery life would be better IF I didnt play games on it so much most of the day Otherwise its a fabulous tablet I just wish they gave me a charging cable instead of the type C to type C cable to switch apps etc What a waste of space in the box since I can do that over Wifi I really did not need that cable I NEED a charging cable Why would they sell something without a way to charge it Extra Makes me think batteries not included Come on Samsung You can DO BETTER Still love the tablet though >>><<< What is shido >>><<< El Performance >>><<< Excellent fast shipping just what I ordered >>><<< I also have the s9 ultra But wanted something smaller to take with me It is everything its larger brother is but in a smaller profile It is fast and picture quality fantastic I like the size at 109 inch Also 5g for Verizon >>><<< Very nice fits perfectly love it >>><<< The product is in excellent condition with the characteristic quality of Samsung but in the description it is mentioned the factory case that came as an accessory in the box along with the cable and the original SPEN but when reviewing the protective case factory for the tablet was not there having been mentioned >>><<< The tablet is very good and everything But I thought the case was already included in that version and apparently not I still highly recommend it a good tablet >>><<< I am so glad I got Samsung tablet instead of IPads limitations Works as expected good picture excellent computing speed no crashes and expansion memory capacity 1 terabyte intalled work seamless with my phone I am able to answer my phone emails text messages from my tablet even it has no phone line installed GREAT to edit my photos anywhere if I am connected to wifi >>><<< I look to Samsung first for the most robust and dependable and utilitarian electronics May not be as artsy as some others but thats not what I use them for >>><<< The size of the tablet 125 provides plenty of space to view any kind of documents There is a split screen feature that takes advantage of the extra viewing space The tablet is much easier to hold if you have a case for it Due to its size it can be awkward to hold without a case The processing speed is very good Downloading is very quick Battery life is adequate >>><<< Very easy to set up even for an 81 year old lady Has more features than I will ever use I love the SPen It is a real great feature I am a Samsung Lady Have been using their products cell phone TV Tablet washing machine etc for a long time and always find they fit my needs Very dependable Highly recommend this tablet >>><<< I bought this to my son to replace a Samsung tablet from 2017 that was struggling pretty hard with games like roblox and minecraft I have to say that Im very impressed with this tablet even considering it doesnt have a Snapdragon on it Everything we have thrown at it has worked without any problems without lowering the gaming experience and or performance The speakers are also very good for what the tablet costs I have an iPad Pro M1 and honestly I found the volume and sound quality to be on par or very close to the iPad The screen is crispy and smooth with good definition contrast and clarity Very happy with this tablet and needless to say my son is very very pleased with it >>><<< Good display Very good battery life Good range on wi fi compared to other devices I have owned Screen slightly shiny for book reading but not a significant issue >>><<< Its worth buying >>><<< Very nice tablet I use to read my books Very easy to set up just transferred data automatically from my Galaxy phone Sort of like a big phone Only negative charging cord did not have a wall adapter >>><<< Great product No issues and very useful >>><<< This tablet is just amazing The screen deliver great colours the sound really immersive when watching a movie Light so you can carry it everywhere easily The touchpen is great The best tab for me >>><<< This is the first product that i have owned in which the battery life is really 18 hours I would charge my Tablet every 3 days The picture quality is average and something that i really wish was better >>><<< Excellent tablet without a doubt I only dont give 5 stars because in the specifications it said that it came with a booktype protector which never arrived I had to buy one separately >>><<< It was hard to buy this to me expensive device I use my 2019 A tab all day long even though I have a very nice desktop computer and a fancy S22 ultra phone I read write research play stupid games shop watch videos access my printer do everything with it iIt cant stay connected to wifi 6 ane wont restart correctly Some sites were not rendering correctly So time for a new tablet It seemed like complete overkill to buy this tablet Dont you think so But it is a gift that I was encouraged to accept We had a lot of AMEX reward dollars that made it easier to buy now that Amazon accepts them I was again encouraged to get this big size It is pretty big Is that necessary I doubt it So far it runs well It magically linked with my phone and now is a second phone Along with my Samsung watch See I told you too much stuff To me it charges very slowly A full charge lasts a long time I am slow to get used to new things but I think I like this device Maybe there was a tablet priced between the Tab A and this one Ok this is the one between the tab A and the S9 tab I get it I like that it is water resistant but I never dunked the old Tab A I bet this new tablet will be dollar200 off in six weeks Oh well >>><<< My son wanted this to help him take notes in his college engineering classes Hes super excited about it and loving it so far >>><<< Tablet does everything I need it to it is replacing my iPad Air2 from 2015 since iOS 15 crippled the still useful thing It is now relegated to my content machine I use this for work where I pair to my phone for emails messaging and network sites and PDF viewing I work in aviation >>><<< I bought it for work design and so far so good its a good piece of equipment >>><<< Very useful practical perfect size and weight Super recommended I arrive very quickly >>><<< It has tons of real estate upgradeable memory via MicroSD up to 1TB it is thin and lightweight >>><<< Very good product >>><<< Excellent condition I got it at a good price >>><<< Work and home >>><<< I love it very much beautiful >>><<< I wanted a big screen and this was perfect runs smooth and connected to my phone so easy >>><<< Great product through and through >>><<< My wife and I each got one of these All the processing power and storage we need for daily internet browsing Colorful screen Speakers are adequate Large screen compared to 101s I have had before >>><<< I say this tablet is excellent plus really good at reasonable price great for those people dont had money buy or dont wanted spend 800 900 or 1000 dollars for tablet It had some features like full flagship tablet of Samsung tab s9 it had dex mode which can use like a laptop come with s pen the speakers are loud enough watch videos and movies Tab s9 fe also had fingerprint Censor I Like how samsung give us options buy different colors of tab s9 fe unlike tab s9 only came with 2 color options Camera are good enough to take pictures and recording videos Samsung galaxy tab s9 fe is water dust resistant so dont had worry about when it raining or getting dust on your tablet basically take with you everywhere There 5g options for this tablet now can Down side with tablet there no snapdragons chip inside of tab s9 fe at least samsung Optimize their chip so wont overheat y The tablet Yet dont mind some Sacrifice of the features still worth buying >>><<< I like that I can take notes on this tablet and save it across all my Samusung Devices to review later >>><<< Good tablet definitely better on my eyes than my older 8 inch tablet I thought when I was researching this tablet that it supported wifi 6 but that is not the case I have wifi 6 turned on and this tablet is unable to see it Too bad but still a nice tablet though I wish I could have bought it without the S pen that I will never use Okay so it looks like it does support wifi 6 as there is a little 6 next to the wifi symbol but it does not support wifi 6E 6ghz band I bought a USB wifi 6E adapter and that worked as it should and detected the 6ghz band >>><<< I loved it For the price it is an excellent tablet everything has worked very well >>><<< I have nothing but good to say about my new tablet Its everything I wanted and was easy to set up >>><<< Screen isnt crazy good but its fine >>><<< very nice >>><<< I love the keyboard has large alphabet and numbers Makes it so easy for me >>><<< The size is perfect for reading books and the battery lasts a long time >>><<< It has worked perfectly for me I use it to edit photos and videos and it does it without any problem I also use it in my IT work and it is super versatile and it has served as a second monitor to present information in an easier and more fluid way Its a shame that it doesnt have video output because its USB 20 but with screen share something is done Fully recommended although if you have a little more dollardollardollar the FE or the S9 would be better >>><<< Works great the pen attaches in more than one spot which a love I have had no issues with it Took it on a road trip battery lasts a long time which is nice Make lists and do homework on it >>><<< Slick Easy on the eyes and the wallet >>><<< Says whats in the box Tablet Cover Case Never got it But absolutely love the tablet Recommend 1010 >>><<< Box contents Smart book cover The case did not arrive it is advisable to check the items better before being sent >>><<< Play Video Excellent product a little dissatisfied with the poor protection of the merchandise they can improve itThank you anyway >>><<< I got this for my 11yr old son for his birthday it was delayed for a week but finally came and is running great >>><<< I really have been enjoying my new tablet I wanted something with a pen so I can do more digital notes for various things like school and genealogy So far it has been good Be careful with the pin number I didnt realize samsung erases everything if the pin code is forgotten So now Ill probably have to factory reset and lose all my notes >>><<< Love it still learning more about the features >>><<< I wanted to get a tablet to use for sheet music and replace my binder of paper sheets It was very easy to start and set up So far no issues I which it came with a wall charger which I had to buy separately >>><<< Display is crisp and very clear colors on screen are very vivid Processors are very fast for all of the tasks I ask of it One speaker on each end equals very nice sound The OS upgraded to Android 14 One UI 60 immediately upon plugging it into my wireless network The OS takes up 1528GB of space Even after loading all of my apps I still have 97GB of free space It is heavier than my 4 year old Galaxy Tab A 101 2019 but I can still hold it with one hand for quite a while before fatigue sets in I view this tablet as a very nice computer for the dollardollardollar I spent on it I believe I made a better choice than picking the Galaxy Tab A9 Without a cover it can be a little slippery >>><<< Very good tablet >>><<< personal use very good product >>><<< Samsung S9fe is a good reasonably priced 109 tablet I got the 256gb and installed a 512gb micro sd card So I have plenty of space My only complaint is that theres no case available except directly from Samsung Amazon has been out of stock for a while I do like the Spen its a real benefit I have swollen fingers its also a large enough circumference to hold comfortably All in all Im pleased The data transfer from my old A7 to this went smoothly I used the provided cable to connect both together and almost everything transferred thats simply a extremely minor annoyance 2 games All in all Im a happy camper >>><<< These work great Theyre a little dark but its OK that you have to try to read the business card inside because nobody needs to see it until they really need to see it >>><<< I like all of the features but the wifi range is slower than my S23 cellphone >>><<< Recommended I would buy it again >>><<< Its excellent for media and study the display has good colors >>><<< Excellent The screen is big >>><<< It does everything I want it to do I was able to connect it to my phone using Bluetoothtethering and it works well >>><<< Im not a Samsung fan but my best tablet ever even better than iPad I recommend it >>><<< While its not built for gaming it does handles all other things efficiently >>><<< Well worth the dollardollardollar Had purchased a Chromebook 2 360 and couldnt get it to connect or sync Contacted Samsung directly actually found out difference between tablet and laptop and this tablet is AMAZING Zero problems connecting and setting up Very easy and quick Also ordered the Samsung Keyboard Case Cover Screen Protector Cant say enough very impressed and its expandable and yes it syncs immediately with your phone and other products Thank you >>><<< I like its practicality and design Especially for students this is a must get >>><<< s and playing games at home If this tablet lasts as long as my older Samsung I will be very pleased >>><<<  extra 4 in the display over the A8 is nice The tablet is definitely bright enough I am keeping the brightness settings at about 10percent I havent tried any games since I dont play them I did check the download and upload speed and it was basically the same as the Tab A8 which is fine for me As far as the OS goes It came with Android 13 and Samsung UI 511 However the Android security update was Aug 1st I imagine it will update soon enough Google Play was June 2023 It took three restarts to bring it up to September which is a Google issue That is it for now I will post an update or two to this once I get more battery and other information Another excellent product from Samsung >>><<< terally have to manually open each file from the cloud onto desktop then save it where you want Or you have to access the files ONE at a time through the cloud click an arrow open the file location cut the file and paste it where you want And of course the file location doesnt have ALL your images in one place it places it within 3 tiers of foldiers for each individual file So after going through 2 tablets hours of support blood sweat and tears I finally have to call it quits on the Samsung Tablet yet again and switch to the 2x more expensive iPad Im so devastated >>>\n",

ipad >>><<< It is designed to meet requirements for certain Android users Not to compete with ipad >>><<< Almost bought one ofnthese Couldnt believe they onlynoffer 128gb and no SD card Thats really the only reason i didnt buy one >>><<< Regarding the words at the beginning I can attest I have a friend who is full on Android Hates Apple to the core But he still uses an iPad for a tablet because the competition is just not there To me this tablet is a step closer if not just because of the aspect ratio I never realized how ideal the ratio is on iPads until I picked up a Galaxy tab So awkward to hold that standard 169 >>><<< When comparing iPad with the top of the competition Apple loses in terms of value for money It is not a rational choice >>><<< Companies need to start making windows tablet It is so much better at opening multiple windows of the same app and it would be great for both work and personal use and make the price more affordable >>><<< No person with a sane mind will buy an ipad >>><<< im samsung fan and im not shy to say it but this is some good of tablet if im buying one i will consider this 100percent >>><<< No one will ever kill or even match the iPad Its the goat and the king of tablets >>><<< As much as i love an iPad the thing that really annoys me is that there is no multiple users feature like on Android It really is just designed for 1 individual In my household none of us need a tablet enough to warrant a tablet each but we do like a single tablet laying around in the living room should you need it Having multiple users ability on android just makes it easier for all your own accounts to be signed in instantly such as emails photos etc for quick access And should someone else want to use it after they have their own profile and all their settings apps etc saved >>><<< Need a iPad Mini competitor pleeeeeaaaaseeeee >>><<< Poor mans iPad lol >>><<< Clone >>><<< They should of allowed user replacable battery and they should of never got rid of the finger print scanner In the UK you can only buy the 128gb version 128gb in 2024 with no expandable storage Just seriously >>><<< Im watching this on an iPad >>><<< When anyone means Tablet he says iPad Android User or Apple User nearly everyone says iPad >>><<< MarcusI use the iPad 6 for homework youtube games and other stuff what iPad should I switch to Ive had this for 5 years >>><<< There are no such thing as iphone killer or ipad killer Apple is being sued for having a monopoly Their iphone and ipad are not just original products but best in class their hardware and software is 12 years ahead of any tech company this is a fact >>><<< I think its both an ipad killer and a clone >>><<< Now that the smallest model Galaxy Tab S has an OLED its easily the best android tablet on the market My entire tech ecosystem is Apple but they didnt have a OLED iPad so I went with the Galaxy and Im so glad I did It definitely filled the void left behind after my Note 20 Ultra broke >>><<< Love how powerful it is have had it 6 weeks and have had no issues with game lag at all the built in performance bar is amazing I record my games and edit them through that Only downside is the battery life but I got a power bank it its working great together Overall very amazing tablet for gaming and cheaper then most so budget friendly and you can game with best performances Thank you love it >>><<< It is an excellent tablet it has a good screen brightness it is very fast to open applications 100percent recommended >>><<< After getting it all setup for my needs I can say I am very happy with this tablet I do not use or care about the pen which seemed to be a problem to others but as far as gaming and watching videos it rocks the refresh rate made the movies pop and were visually crisp I got the 8gb256gb version but I still wanted more storage I solved that with a USBC SD card reader I found one with USB TypeC port and 5Gbps Data rate for under ten dollars and it is as small as a Wireless USB mouse dongle The wireless is fast and I have had no issues with it or the bluetooth both have been flawless so far browsing and gaming run buttery smooth >>><<< The 300 PPI screen is great for reading technical PDFs The video watching experience is worse than on an OLED screen for obvious reasons Everything works fast and smoothly Battery life so far has been great But there are two flaws in my opinion 1 There is visible vignetting at the edges of the screen 2 The UI is much worse than say Samsung Its hard to get to the list of open apps It takes me 510 attempts on average to get this done The floating windows feature is annoying and cannot be turned off >>><<< Its honestly better than I expected for the price it has good specs and so far no hiccups >>><<< Legit global rom confirmed w serial number Includes a 33 watt charger >>><<< It is a very solid tablet for the price The finishes are high and the materials are durable and somewhat luxurious compared to its price Its screen size and stereo sound are of very good quality this is incredible for watching series playing video games and more multimedia things However the only negative side would be the battery life but this is offset by Xiaomis fast charging I consider this tablet to be a solid product just like its predecessor the Xiaomi pad 5 >>><<< Very good price quality but it is not good for gaming like Fortnite or Genshin Impact >>><<< The truth is that this tablet is excellent in terms of qualityprice it is the second one I have bought both supplier and excellent product The only detail on this occasion was that they sent me a charger that is not the correct input >>><<< Purchase and shipping I purchased the Tablet via Pix on 01242024 After payment confirmation I received the tracking code that allowed tracking via the Correios website The timeline for this followup looked like this 0126 Object posted in China 0131 Object received by Correios do Brasil at the International Center in Curitiba 0502 Electronic information sent for analysis by the customs authority 0902 Analysis completed Import authorized 0902 Customs inspection completed awaiting payment 0215 Payment confirmed 0217 Departure from the International Center towards my state So Paulo 0219 Object arrives in So Paulo 0220 Object delivered to recipient Taking the entire process into account it took less than 1 month to arrive at my home Unboxing and product If you have knowledge about processors and tabletsmartphone components you know that this device is a real machine An excellent value for money But leaving aside this technical information the product arrived well packaged and sealed When you open it you come face to face with the tablet which is well protected In the box there are instruction manuals a USB TypeC cable and a 33W power supply When you turn on the device you already notice that the screen is incredibly beautiful with excellent definition The sound is loud and clear and the fluidity of the

makes zero sense to mention head room in terms of performance when 95percent of iPad apps literally dont take advantage of those overpowered chips Hence why you see no difference in daytoday tasks Apple is using those chips to overcharge customers for something thats not even being utilized properly among most apps >>><<< Image quality on the current iPad Pro is much worse Literally you say nothing about the awful ghosting on the edges of the display Some of them even have greenblack tints among the ghosting >>><<< Apples iPads cost as much as gaming PCs And dont forget Apple is raising

pencil sucks Come on 130 bucks for outdated technology It has been untouched for more than 4 years now and is so unconfortable to use give it a try to the S pen and you will never look back at the

screen size And I paid dollar1200 for the 512Gb Tab S9 Ultra Keyboard Cover and S Pen All in the same package If it were on the iPad it would cost around dollar2500 here in Brazil And on the Samsung

from Amazon to see which I would like The Tab A9 11inch model appears to be a clear winner I previously had an 8inch Galaxy Tab7 lite which was about 8 inches This new Tabsa9 plus is 11 inches so about 15 inches longer and wider For ereaders I use LIBBY it is a bit big but slender and can still fit on the top of treadmill ledges and is a decent size for airplane travel The new tablet is super light so hardly any weight difference Screen is super bright and the computing power is fast Im a macapple user but found that it seems to be seamlessly and quickly connecting to my iphone 15 I ordered an electronic pen for writing notes and the size of this seems perfect for it I also ordered a glass screen protector and a case both were cheap This tab device is fantastic in that you can easily buy and load additional storage space It is a Ferrari of an ereader but with the electronic pen writing capacity plus colorful screen and fast computing power it works great as a notebook style computer Really for the money it retails for dollar219 it is a fantastic buy The ipads from Apple were all 35 times the price To get an ipad for this price I needed to go to an old whoknows how long it will work 2017 model ipad No question this is a wonderful product by Samsung and Im speaking as a fan of Apple I totally recommend this tablet at this time at least Once I start really using it If I have any dissatisfactions Ill post an edited review >>><<< Excellent value and the screen is vivid and responsive like all Samsung products I opted to NOT get the version for a phone service as I can always link my smartphone to this screen if needed It readily connects to wifi and I suggest using a VPN for security as well as using the Brave browser and turning off typical Google data harvesting features like location It does not come with a USBC power source just a cable If you dont have one a charger with this output consider buying one when you purchase the tablet I also found it charges well from another USBC charger I normally use for my smartphone You will probably also want to get a screen protector there are MANY brands and types available to select from at costs ranging from dollar5 to about dollar80 I chose one that protects the screen and serves as a stand but is flat and allows me to carry the tablet in my vest without worrying about scratching the screen >>><<< i orginaly got this for my digital keyboard and media consumption but then i started using it for school and to help me study imo it was very worth its price i ended up buying another for a family member since it was so useful and affordable i dont use it to write notes but i did play around with writing on it and it didnt seem bad at all i just enjoy paper notes more the battery life is great and the screen is nice obviously its not an ultra 4k hd screen but it is very nice and i never feel like i need more in my time using it i have not felt like i needed more in any aspect i havent used the dex mode since i dont need it but i can imagine it working very nicely since i always have multiple apps open when doing school work it has helped me so much from what i originally got it for and very much exceeded my expectations if your looking for a very nice inexpensive tablet theres no reason not to get this one i have the 8g ram and its never felt slow i bought a 4gb for a family member and they have never noticed any issues with it >>><<< Ive had this tablet for about a day and put it through its paces with all the streaming apps that I use except one that wont work with the tablet because it hasnt been updated by the service and it worked wonderfully for all of them The FullHD capable screen is bright and punchy while the speakers are crisp and clear with or without the Dolby Atmos sound enhancement turned on As far as gaming goes its not a gaming tablet by any means but it will play most older Android titles fairly well particularly the puzzle games or JRPG ports from various companies like Kemco and SquareEnix The one and only area in which this tablet falls short in all metrics is the WiFi as Samsung chose to use a cheap WiFi chip that only has a single connection that means no MIMO WiFi and it tops out at 433Mbps which means its WiFi is subpar and does not pair well with the speedy CPU and RAM that would give superfast download speeds and a stronger WiFi connection with a 2x2 WiFi design Apart from that the tablet is almost perfect though some may find Samsungs latest One UI to be clunky and awkward to use as it has some quirky design flaws that detract from usability in comparison to regular Android tablets that use Googles own interface >>><<< This thing is great Large screen and long battery life Using it for work so not really stressing it out at all but it runs smoothly The camera sticks out a good amount so if you plan to not use a case be aware of that And it takes a long time to charge up even on a super fast charger no super charge option only fast and normal but still over night its good to go Expandable storage is really nice and it seamlessly captured the data from my current samsung device >>><<< I purchased this tablet primary for reading as I needed something that could run the Cloud Library app for digital library books So far it has served me well with no issues The Samsung A9 replaces my Kindle Fire and it is faster and far superior I have streamed video and played a few games on it as well and it does its jobs If youre not looking for anything with lots of bells and whistles this is a good middle of the road tablet >>><<< This was an upgrade from my iPad Personally I like android devices I dont need anything too in depth This is perfect for my use Emails Texts Web A few game apps and uTube I also like pairing it to my Galaxy phone to make and receive calls Good value and good item Satisfied with this purchase >>><<< This is my 4th Samsung galaxy tablet Each has been an upgrade Where do I start The larger screen is nice The graphics are awesome The sound with the Dolby Atmos system is really great The smooth screen refresh rate is amazing The colors are rich The better wifi connections are so nice I really enjoy using my new tablet Getting it on sale was a bonus For the price it cant be beat Transferring everything from my old tablet was seamless I cant say enough about this tablet Highly recommended >>><<< My old samsung tablet died after many years of use I knew I wanted another samsung so I tried several different ones before going with this one I liked the large screen of the 124 A9 FE but with a case it was heavier than I was looking for and felt too large for travelling I looked at a different samsung 11 but the graphics were not as good as the 124 But this one does have the nice graphics and with a case it doesnt feel too heavy and is compact enough for travel More than I wanted to spend on a tablet but given my previous Samsung tablet lasted about 10 years I decided it was worth it and so far it has been >>><<< I mostly bought this tablet just to stream shows and read on Both of which it does perfectly The tablet is quick and snappy with loading and navigating which is probably due it its Qualcomm processor Ive found myself frustrated many times trying to use slow and sluggish budget devices so Im very satisfied with the experience here The 1080p picture on the lcd display isnt anything amazing but for a budget device it gets by I love the smooth 90hz capability as well However I dont love that out of box my unit suffers from a dead pixel on the lcd but fortunately its so small that its barely noticeable Its not a deal breaker for me I just expect better quality control from Samsung Surprisingly a major positive is the sound quality I found myself ditching the earbuds a lot with this tablet The sound is loud and clear with its four speakers Very surprising for a budget device Overall Id recommend this tablet to anyone wants an affordable and capable device either for work or leasure I havent tried gaming on it but Im sure it would handle itself pretty well A great value but If this tablet goes on sale than its pretty much a no brainer Note Annoyingly this tablet doesnt a include a USBC charging brick I had to use my phone charger instead because the included charging cable was USBC to USBC I only own USBA bricks So be prepared >>><<< I love the tablet however the one I ordered from Amazon I had to return It was advertised as being the 5g model When I took it to my internet provider it did not have the correct chip holder for wifi operation I ended up getting the same tablet but with the correct chip card holder from my provider and returning the one to Amazon I wanted the new Samsung tablet especially for its 5g capabilities I figured out later that was probably why the Amazon one was a lot less in price Still a wonderful tablet And Amazon readily took back the original one >>><<< Im giving it a 4 out 5 stars because Im a be honest with you I HOPE THE WAY I WRITE THIS DOESNT MESS UP Pros Big Screen 90Hz Refresh Rate Not Adaptive Btw 1080p Quality 1920x1080 not changeable just FHD Big Battery Life Can Game but remember 64GB Storage 4GB RAM but 128GB Storage 8GB RAM Micro SD Card Up to 1TB I think u can put SIM Card too Maybe Has Samsung Dex To Turn it into a mini PC Has the 3 dots on the edge for keyboard and mouse Cheaper than the S Models of Samsung Tablets Cons TFT Panel Looks LCD to me but it doesnt have OLED Colors are not as good as OLED devices which is too be expected Charging Takes Long but last awhile just not sure what is the maximum fast charging it can take Maybe 20 watts Doesnt have SPen No 120Hz Refrest Rate Not ADAPTIVE 1120Hz No QHD 2560x1440p Viewing Angles are alright but you can notice the LCDTFT display always the blacks are not looking black instead its dark grayish Camera is okay still blurry >>><<< I upgraded from a Galaxy A8 and loving this tablet except for the current software bug effecting these A9 models There is an issue with the multipoint touch such as when pinch zooming or playing a game that involves 2 fingers touching at the same time It is very glitchy You kinda have to finesse the pinch zoom with a light touch and it will work If you dont play games and arent constantly using the pinch zoom function which most probably arent you will hardly notice the issue Though if you play games involving multitouch this will be a problem for you Strangely though if you plug corded headphones into the jack the problem stops really weird It does seem to just be a software bug though and Samsung should be able to fix the problem with an update patch Unfortunately little problems like this are just part of the technological world we live in now and occasionally happens to the devices we use and they need to be updated Other than that though This tablet feels nice and light runs fast and smooth with the upgraded processor and increased 8GB of RAM on the A9 model and the screen has a beautiful bright picture with nice deep and vibrant colors I did a side by side HD video comparison with my A8 and the picture on the A9 is quite a noticeable improvement And I see people saying that theres didnt come with a charger as if its a mistake It is not a mistake Samsung doesnt send chargers with their products anymore They say its to minimize their impact on the environment or whatever and also because I think they know most people have plenty of charging blocks and USB C cables laying around at this point being that so many products use them now and if you dont you can buy one very cheap With all that said if you can deal with the current multitouch problem until its fixed I high >>><<< My 2017 8 A8 is getting long in the tooth Ive had some software incompatibility show up Android 9 doesnt cut it anymore The battery is also starting to lose charge a bit The A9 has Android 14 and a new battery so those issues are gone Everything seems to work according to Samsungs usual high standards People in reviews seem to complain about slow charging Its 2024 folks My fast chargers have no problem charging it up in a few hours My one complaint is the size 11 inches is great for sitting on a desktop and viewing things but I have a television and a laptop for that I miss the old A8s 8 screen that allowed for comfortable handholding Alas even the new A8 is 10 inches I looked at other brands but Samsung was still the best bet >>><<< Bought for chef at restaurant I work at He photographs the dishes with the camera feature and the picture quality is awesome Whenever hes off the other chefs can use the tablet to reference the dish in question He also photographs new dishes and sends them to the owners to inquire on a possible new special >>><<< This tablet has been doing very well for me There is a transfer program built in that helps you step by step move your data from your old Samsung Galaxy Tab to this new one The processor is very good there is a plentiful amount of RAM and there still are ports you can plug into I got the HXCASEAC Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 A9 Plus Case 11 Inch and it is also the second time Ive bought this case Protective rubber and a built in screen protector Shamefully I was upgrading from a Tab 7 and probably wouldnt have done that if the batteries hadnt swollen and gotten hot But back to this tablet If youve had a Tab before worry not here things just got better The colors the feels its all there I purchased a 1TB MicroSD card and it has a home in this Tab 9 Beyond that Im not sure what I can say about this Tab oh yeah its from Samsung so its full of Samsung goodness >>><<< At first I was hesitant because being a tablet I always doubt if it will be good or not or if it will be fast But I must confess that this tablet has surprised me I bought it for my 5 year old son for his school work It is very fast lightweight with a friendly and updated operating system It met my expectations 100percent >>><<< I use my tablet constantly for playing games having virtual Doctors appointments online shopping and online banking It is very fast fastest Ive ever had actually and it is so easy to use I absolutely love how thin it is and lightweight Because a lot of them are super heavy for what they are I love that this has a 128 GB of storage Cause I can have any app that I have Heart set on and I dont have to worry about anything going over Or having backup storage You can also use a microSD card with it I have not needed to but I do own one if that is ever needed Overall This is the best tablet Ive ever owned and Ive owned a lot of different tablets over the years I love this more than my previous iPad And my previous Kindle HD 10 highly recommended 10 out of 10 >>><<< Ok so I originally tried the Amazon Fire because it claimed to be so awesome Im still waiting for the refund But this Samsung so far has been a jewel for me So far so good Very happy to have found this one for 10dollar less than the Fire that has no special features >>><<< I was looking around for a Samsung tablet and found a variety of them priced all over the place I ordered one for dollar79 and it ran out of memory very quickly I was constantly deleting photos and music in order to have enough memory for my apps I realized I needed something with a lot more memory I looked at some of the Samsung Tablets that cost as much as dollar800 before settling on the Samsung Tab A9 Its probably not as good as the top of the line Samsung Tablets but on the other hand it was only dollar199 and for that price its a bargain >>><<< We have has the A9 a couple days now We have each has Samsung tablets for several years We have liked them This one has features to love We have however spent more time with it on the charger than in our hands >>><<< Maybe my old tablet was just too old to not appreciate the evolution and trends of tablets in general but the screen on this tablet is so much nicer than what I had previously Definitely it has a speedperformance advantage as well >>><<< Best work tablet Ive had the only reason for taking off 1 star is the battery takes 2 or more hours to charge up from 30percent and it drains down to that in about 3 hours of use Thats with a brand name rapid charger and a high quality cable As others have mentioned the USB receptacle takes extra care to plug in firmly A small hassle but worth it to me for the overall performance >>><<< As far as Im concerned everything should be made by Samsung it is a great company the color is vivid ease operation touch works great put a cover on it in a safe screen high performance product great job >>><<< I bought this to use as an inexpensive tablet I could use while backpacking I was looking for something really basic that I could read at camp check maps and listen to music offline while hiking Being a Samsung it meant I would be able to find a decent case for it to provide at least some basic protection If it got damaged during the hike well it was a cheap tablet so it should be good enough It had 55percent battery when it arrived so I plugged it into a USBC cable I had plugged into the USB port on my wall outlet I figured this would be alright since it would need to be charged from a portable power source in the field anyway After 48 minutes it managed to charge only to 64percent I wanted to err on it being my cable so I plugged it into a USBC power brick instead and put that in my outlet My wall outlets are 20w and this requires 15w to charge so it should totally work It managed to hit 100percent 45 hours later Taking four and a half hours to charge anything 36percent is insane When I finally was able to power the tablet on the screen was so dim I could barely see anything After rushing through the typical Android setup I managed to increase the display brightness to around 50percent After installing 3 apps I noticed that the battery was at 93percent for less than a half hour of use I definitely do not recommend this tablet The cons far outweigh the pros in this device especially since finding a budget tablet is not really that hard to find these days >>><<< I bought this as a second tablet besides my S6 Lite I love it because of the bigger storage and the picture and sound quality are amazing The screen is several inches bigger than my S6 Lite but its not too big The only thing I didnt like was that it didnt come with the S Pen which I know it didnt but bought some capacitive stylus and problem solved Overall I am very happy with this tablet I will always stick to Samsung for phones air buds and tablets as they are hard to beat >>><<< This is supposed to be the lower end affordable tabletI honestly like it better than the more expensive flagship tablet I got my wife The speakers are phenomenal the picture is top shelf I highly recommend Also awesome it included headphone jack and SD card expansion up to 1TB >>><<< The lighter weight makes this tablet easier to use than my last Galaxy I really trust Samsung products they always have superior quality and ease of use Will buy again in future if need be >>><<< I got my tablet on Saturday I am very happy with 8t It was easy to set up Its fast Everything I needed is in this tablet So far I love my new tablet I recommend ordering this tablet for yourself >>><<< Ive always had the best Galaxy tablets the S series Thought Id try A series Verdict not quite as quick or sharp as S but overall satisfactory What youll notice most a little hesitation and jerkiness when you pinch or expand screen size with your fingers Works better when you resize a little slower and smoother Update on 3324 That hesitation and jerkiness when you use fingers to pinchexpand screen is worse than I thought its intolerable Im going to live with it for now but contrary to what I wrote I would not buy A9 again For dollar200 more I could have had the crispness speed and smooth functionality of the S9 >>><<< I purchased the Samsung Galaxy A9 8128 model and inputted a 128 GB Samsung SD card and am able to offset app space and downloads right to the card to conserve space I have had the tablet for a week and have no speed or input issues and visually the tablet itself is sleek I am using for work and have had no productivity issues sharing service and apps between my ZFold 3 I recommend purchase I shopped around for two months and am happy with my choice Will provide update in 6 months but anticipate no issues Battery lasts roughly 32 hours on full charge with mid to full use each day I am happy with that Fast charging is complete in 15 hours from 5percent Regardless research anyway and make the best choice for you >>><<< Very nice Samsung tablet lots of storage Big battery but can not be fast charged Last night I was at 27percent battery I plugged it in and this morning it was only on 83percent 7 hours S pen does not work on this tablet You can draw in Samsung notes but you cant write with a stylist Its a little too big for holding it But its great on a table or desk Over all a great tablet at a great price >>><<< Purchased another tablet but found it difficult for a tech challenged person to use This tablet was easy to set up and easy to use >>><<< I havent personally owned a tablet that I loved since the Nexus 7 which still bring back fond memories You cannot go wrong with this tablet buti have to be honest Im a samsung guy Another great product that I use for college and for my personal Bible study >>><<< The A9 is a good general use product It doesnt have a high res screen with OLED or 120Hz but it gets the job done I really appreciated the headphone jack and MicroSD card slot However I wish it had a fingerprint reader and frontfacing speakers The screen is sharp at this size but it dims noticeably off angle Luckily the battery charges quickly Also a case can be gotten on Amazon for under dollar500 >>><<< No issues so far i use this for bills and app i dont want on my phone everything i needed was available for download so thats a plus for me >>><<< The tablet fits my needs to a T Now you can 100percent notice its a 1080p resolution and 60hz refresh rate Its definitely a budget tablet but plays games no problem screen is nice and bright and the speakers sound pretty good If you dont mind the lower resolution and refresh rate then this is the best option for you >>><<< This tablet could be made by anyone There appears to be no external branding However it is all Samsung in its operation >>><<< I was promised a case with this product to no avail I called Amazon and they took 10percent off my purchased however now the tablet is selling for a great deal lower than what I paid for it terrible advertising the sound is very good with this tablet however the charging takes a very long time the battery life is mediocre I would return the product to get to get the product dollar50 cheaper but I dont want to go through all the trouble beware it does not come with a case thats the reason why I purchased it that and the sound quality >>><<< Extremely satisfied with my purchase bought this one to upgrade from Amazon fire 10 and glad I made the choice I like it better than any other tablet Ive had screen is a great size for less strain on the eyes >>><<< So far happy with the purchase installing and updating the applications Everything arrived perfectly by DHL >>><<< I love the tablet only complaint you need to send a compatible plug >>><<< Good quality and uses the same OS as my phones Transferring files was a BREEZE I would do business with this seller again >>><<< I use this every day its fast and glad I got it >>><<< I bought 2 tab from this seller the first one was brand new and saw how good it was I order a 2nd one for my niece the second one i got it was not brand new it had the sticker when you give a second chance an item I know and i remember well I order a new one not a used one I dont mind this but please state what one is ordering because i paid for a brand new item and it came in a bag >>><<< I did not receive the cover that came with the tablet according to the photo I received a cover that came with the glass but it did not arrive with the tablet >>><<< I love this tablet connected perfectly with my android Doesnt lag and so manyyyy features Get it >>><<< Tablet really nice but its static alot Takes a long time to startup and sometimes screen cannot be cleared I really miss my Samsung T820 Tablet its broken thats why i got this A9 but its lagging I should be returning shortlyexchanging >>><<< I had to replace my tablet ASAP and this was the upgrade This was dollar100 less than what I was going to pay at my retailer Exact same tablet It works great is a great size Great purchase Im so happy with this tablet >>><<< THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS VERY GOOD IT MEETS MY NEEDS AT THE MOMENT THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT THE SUPPLIER OFFERS THE BOOK COVER FOR FREE WITH THE PURCHASE FOR THE GRAPHITE COLOR AND IN THE END IT DOESNT BRING IT I STILL KEPT THE TABLET AND BUY A SEPARATE COVER >>><<< This tablet is nice Im very happy with it Does everything with no lagging and very nice >>><<< After a long long time my old Samsung 7 tablet finally conked out It was too slow and didnt have enough storage anyway I knew I was going to buy another Samsung but wanted a good deal I splurged and bought the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9 11 Tablet w 128GB of storage My God this is super FAST If you are watching a video its like having a small TV in your lap table or hand The speed and storage is incredible Plus lots and lots of new features since my old one Suggestion buy a screen protector and a cover to keep it like new >>><<< A little heavier than expected but not by much Other than that the best you can get at this range price >>><<< Its a Samsung A9 5G whats not to like no more wifi if I dont want connect to it in public locations Loaded software is more than adequate to do most all of your basic work or play music and videos needs will buy again >>><<< I returned due to I needed wireless service not just wifi >>><<< I mostly use it for Facebook in my library app to read books It works great and I love it >>><<< The tablet is very good it is large and for the price it is worth it for social networks and music and entertainment OK The sorrow >>><<< Very happy with tablet and case >>><<< I have been using this tablet for a few weeks and love it No glitches or delays Would purchase again >>><<< Received my tablet in 1day really not even 24hrs Opened the box connected with a QR on my phone and my setup was complete in less than 10 minutes So far our bonding is going well >>><<< Great tablet BUT it doesnt come with a charger that I was unaware of so if you going to buy this device make sure you buy a type C charger with it because it doesnt come with one It comes with the charger cord but not the charger adapter that you plug into the outlet >>><<< I like the big sceen and it being the A series for the budget price >>><<< Inexpensive easy to navigate works as intended >>><<< Like everything about this unit Sound system is incredibly perfect with 4 speakerscase for this tablet with its 11 screen is a tad difficult to find but is attainable here on Amazonjust pay CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SCREEN SIZEEZY TO M AKE MISTAKEFASTSAFEDELIVERYALL GOOD RAS24 >>><<< I bought so that I could use Smart View to Cast Dribbleup on to my Roku TV I tried lower versions but they either didnt have a high enough Android OS original not updated 12 which messes up the dribbleup sound or they didnt have SmartView software to wirelessly cast I boughtreturned about 3 samsungs before I found a good one and I didnt want a phone version just because it would have been too small without the TV So this worked The only thing is that I have to search for smartview when Im in settings I cant just scroll down to it like Id like to >>><<< The tablet is an excellent product and is easy to setup and use >>><<< Wouldnt recommend it for gaming otherwise it works quite nicely as a media device >>><<< This was a birthday present for my husband Its just what he wanted >>><<< I replaced my Lenovo with this I should have gotten Samsung in the 1st place >>><<< Works great and priced at a awesome price >>><<< Its perfect for what I wanted >>><<< This thing does everything I need and I love it Its very fast and has an memory to hold all the games I want to play >>><<< Memory good Battery has good life faster than Galaxy A tablet all streaming apps work well >>><<< I purchased a different tablet 2 years ago it was so slow I reset it to factory settings it was just useless LOL I did my research and all the fingers pointed by this And boy am I glad I did It was delivered to my house in like 2 days fantastic price and it has a speed as fast as a bullet I am so loving this tablet It absolutely does everything If I had an extra thumb Id give it three thumbs up LOL >>><<< Tab fits small organization or personal use perfectly >>><<< The tablet does the job The only draw back is the Super slow recharge speed And if youre looking for a good S pen at low price The CCIVV Stylus Pen 2 in 1 Fine Point Mesh Tip Stylus for Touch Screen Compatible for Tablet and Cellphone works great with the tablet >>><<< Have no complaints Great tablet >>><<< Nice >>><<< I really like this tablet Its fast the screen is big and clear Also since I have a Samsung phone it quickly moved all of my apps over

also Quality and price cannot be beat >>><<< Bought this to work with my Cricut Joy able to link up >>><<< No complaints whatsoever Good size fits the hands well clear and sharp screen fast And the

everything from existing old Samsung tablet >>><<< I had a Fire tablet which was great but my cat decided to launch it off my dresser and the screen broke So this is my replacement I have a Samsung phone so this was a no brainer for me It does everything I need and allows me to be work productive >>><<< I ordered this tablet for my husband because his old one was getting really slow and he wanted to upgrade The new one was just what he wanted and its big enough for him to see with ease It was reasonably priced too >>><<< My husband has the earlier version of this tablet I would walk by and see him enjoying using it That said I really wanted it for music and solitaire and reading the news with these older eyes and just surfing for stuff Got it loaded it up took a whileand after 2 days of use asked myself what took you so long to get one Its wonderful The sound quality is amazing and the screen qualityperfect Went back for a really pretty girlie case to have it sit on my lap Who needs a apple Not me Thank you >>><<< Very happy with it >>><<< Ive only had the tablet for a little over a week but love it so far I wanted something smaller than the laptop for traveling and its perfect I was able to get all my apps loaded My kindle app has all my books I can manage my bills on this I can listen to music or even watch a movie Its lightweight after charging it the first time I didnt have to charge it again for 9 days So far its great >>><<< Ease setup perfect size Travel readyget the case and charger with it >>><<< Delivery on time good seller >>><<< This tablet is really big and runs smooth I have zero complaints the camera isnt the best of the best but who buys a tablet for the camera The performance battery life screen resolution are top notch You wont be disappointed I want to mention though that this is a WiFi only version of the tab A9 Plus so you cant use a physical SIM card nor an e Sim >>><<< Good size price and performance Wish the little setup leaflet had more explicit instructions If I were not a longterm Samsung and android user Im not sure setup would have gone well Overall I am satisfied and would recommend I have zero interest in games so cant speak to that aspect >>><<< I have had the A9 now for 10 days so I have got a good feel for it and as far as tablets under dollar250 this will be tough to beat I love the big screen that comes with it Its great for Netflix and YouTube or anything else like that You dont get 4K with this tablet but 1080 is more than good enough You get great audio and the battery life is exceptional On a full charge you get 2 days of use and thats with me heavily using it I recommend getting the 128 gb version of this tablet given its a tremendous value If you are use to using a laptop or a PC this tablet comes equipped with Samsung Dex which gives you that same look and feel so thats a big plus Overall its a really good tablet for the price that comes with a lot of bells and whistles you see with a expensive tablet I highly recommend >>><<< Excellent Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 with 64 GB quad speakersNetflix is now soundtasticthis upgrade was under dollar200 Awesome features and speed Also the

Samsung thats what my phone is I just think they could have done better with this I think the price is a little to high for a 2023 and no more than what it is >>><<< ly recommend getting this tablet as everything else about it is great >>>\n",
      "<<< Thanks for the video >>><<< I bought and returned S7 just recently The reason is ridiculous Samsung integrated a Samsung account into it and if you cant sign in into your Samsung account you cant pass the initial setup process which means you cannot use the tablet My twofactor authentication phone number on Samsung account is the old one and I couldnt pass the initial setup because of that Spent several days many hours with Samsung tech support there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what against their policy which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what ever So I couldnt complete the initial setup and had to return it Stupidity is on the next level >>><<< going Android is too much sacrifice lol >>><<< Have you heard of the

really typing on tiny things kind of sucks >>><<< It cant be an ipad killer Actually all android pads features and powers are wasted What makes ipad good is its app store You can make the most of the iPads abilities because you have adobe apps Microsoft affinity photo and alot of good pdf reading apps like notability but android So what we actually need is more support from google i guess >>><<< how curious here in brazil a s9 ultra is way cheaper than an ipad pro I wonder why >>><<< I want that tablet >>><<< The tablet acrobat of juggernauts in the flat in you hand world is the s tab series razor thin and sharp strong connection is a phenomenal tablet when I say phenomenal I mean exquisite I Boasted over these tablets last year so I know this tablet is better but I might not get to experience it because there might be a Ten before I can get my hands on one so yes I agree that tablet does damage to the iPad but wait for ios and soc capability is pretty impressive due to the fact it will lock you out of the dawm device for a month and once you get it unlocked its like it was never locked I really cant say the same thing for Samsung s tab Because we know once its gone thats it so who cares its multitasking and customizability knocks that apple out of the tree also the UNIX lossy storage is very useful in certain use cases then you have expandable storage of s tab you just cant beat it thats it >>><<< thank you >>><<< Whats up everyone I hope this complete Tab S9 lineup buying Guide was helpful Did I cover what you wanted to know What else did you want to see or learn

physical home button is great >>><<< Just a question Is there good ecosystem feature i can have between a tab a8 and my galaxy A10 >>><<< FYI friends to correct our friend anything with the ability to plug into a hub or even direct to external SSD has pretty much unlimited storage for files That said an SD slot is far more convenient be it a lot slower than an SSD drive At this point we had SSD drives that are pretty darn small and can be attached right to the back of a device offering 1 2 or even 4 TBs of storage dirt cheap The world of tablets continues to get better Start with apps you

Better than ipad >>><<< I just got this Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 11 inch model I ordered an IPAD 5th generation from Amazon to see which I would like The Tab A9 11inch model appears to be a clear winner I previously had an 8inch Galaxy Tab7 lite which was about 8 inches This new Tabsa9 plus is 11 inches so about 15 inches longer and wider For ereaders I use LIBBY it is a bit big but slender and can still fit on the top of treadmill ledges and is a decent size for airplane travel The new tablet is super light so hardly any weight difference Screen is super bright and the computing power is fast Im a macapple user but found that it seems to be seamlessly and quickly connecting to my iphone 15 I ordered an electronic pen for writing notes and the size of this seems perfect for it I also ordered a glass screen protector and a case both were cheap This tab device is fantastic in that you can easily buy and load additional storage space It is a Ferrari of an ereader but with the electronic pen writing capacity plus colorful screen and fast computing power it works great as a notebook style computer Really for the money it retails for dollar219 it is a fantastic buy The ipads from Apple were all 35 times the price To get an ipad for this price I needed to go to an old whoknows how long it will work 2017 model ipad No question this is a wonderful product by Samsung and Im speaking as a fan of Apple I totally recommend this tablet at this time at least Once I start really using it If I have any dissatisfactions Ill post an edited review >>><<< Excellent value and the screen is vivid and responsive like all Samsung products I opted to NOT get the version for a phone service as I can always link my smartphone to this screen if needed It readily connects to wifi and I suggest using a VPN for security as well as using the Brave browser and turning off typical Google data harvesting features like location It does not come with a USBC power source just a cable If you dont have one a charger with this output consider buying one when you purchase the tablet I also found it charges well from another USBC charger I normally use for my smartphone You will probably also want to get a screen protector there are MANY brands and types available to select from at costs ranging from dollar5 to about dollar80 I chose one that protects the screen and serves as a stand but is flat and allows me to carry the tablet in my vest without worrying about scratching the screen >>><<< i orginaly got this for my digital keyboard and media consumption but then i started using it for school and to help me study imo it was very worth its price i ended up buying another for a family member since it was so useful and affordable i dont use it to write notes but i did play around with writing on it and it didnt seem bad at all i just enjoy paper notes more the battery life is great and the screen is nice obviously its not an ultra 4k hd screen but it is very nice and i never feel like i need more in my time using it i have not felt like i needed more in any aspect i havent used the dex mode since i dont need it but i can imagine it working very nicely since i always have multiple apps open when doing school work it has helped me so much from what i originally got it for and very much exceeded my expectations if your looking for a very nice inexpensive tablet theres no reason not to get this one i have the 8g ram and its never felt slow i bought a 4gb for a family member and they have never noticed any issues with it >>><<< Ive had this tablet for about a day and put it through its paces with all the streaming apps that I use except one that wont work with the tablet because it hasnt been updated by the service and it worked wonderfully for all of them The FullHD capable screen is bright and punchy while the speakers are crisp and clear with or without the Dolby Atmos sound enhancement turned on As far as gaming goes its not a gaming tablet by any means but it will play most older Android titles fairly well particularly the puzzle games or JRPG ports from various companies like Kemco and SquareEnix The one and only area in which this tablet falls short in all metrics is the WiFi as Samsung chose to use a cheap WiFi chip that only has a single connection that means no MIMO WiFi and it tops out at 433Mbps which means its WiFi is subpar and does not pair well with the speedy CPU and RAM that would give superfast download speeds and a stronger WiFi connection with a 2x2 WiFi design Apart from that the tablet is almost perfect though some may find Samsungs latest One UI to be clunky and awkward to use as it has some quirky design flaws that detract from usability in comparison to regular Android tablets that use Googles own interface >>><<< This thing is great Large screen and long battery life Using it for work so not really stressing it out at all but it runs smoothly The camera sticks out a good amount so if you plan to not use a case be aware of that And it takes a long time to charge up even on a super fast charger no super charge option only fast and normal but still over night its good to go Expandable storage is really nice and it seamlessly captured the data from my current samsung device >>><<< I purchased this tablet primary for reading as I needed something that could run the Cloud Library app for digital library books So far it has served me well with no issues The Samsung A9 replaces my Kindle Fire and it is faster and far superior I have streamed video and played a few games on it as well and it does its jobs If youre not looking for anything with lots of bells and whistles this is a good middle of the road tablet >>><<< This was an upgrade from my iPad Personally I like android devices I dont need anything too in depth This is perfect for my use Emails Texts Web A few game apps and uTube I also like pairing it to my Galaxy phone to make and receive calls Good value and good item Satisfied with this purchase >>><<< This is my 4th Samsung galaxy tablet Each has been an upgrade Where do I start The larger screen is nice The graphics are awesome The sound with the Dolby Atmos system is really great The smooth screen refresh rate is amazing The colors are rich The better wifi connections are so nice I really enjoy using my new tablet Getting it on sale was a bonus For the price it cant be beat Transferring everything from my old tablet was seamless I cant say enough about this tablet Highly recommended >>><<< My old samsung tablet died after many years of use I knew I wanted another samsung so I tried several different ones before going with this one I liked the large screen of the 124 A9 FE but with a case it was heavier than I was looking for and felt too large for travelling I looked at a different samsung 11 but the graphics were not as good as the 124 But this one does have the nice graphics and with a case it doesnt feel too heavy and is compact enough for travel More than I wanted to spend on a tablet but given my previous Samsung tablet lasted about 10 years I decided it was worth it and so far it has been >>><<< I mostly bought this tablet just to stream shows and read on Both of which it does perfectly The tablet is quick and snappy with loading and navigating which is probably due it its Qualcomm processor Ive found myself frustrated many times trying to use slow and sluggish budget devices so Im very satisfied with the experience here The 1080p picture on the lcd display isnt anything amazing but for a budget device it gets by I love the smooth 90hz capability as well However I dont love that out of box my unit suffers from a dead pixel on the lcd but fortunately its so small that its barely noticeable Its not a deal breaker for me I just expect better quality control from Samsung Surprisingly a major positive is the sound quality I found myself ditching the earbuds a lot with this tablet The sound is loud and clear with its four speakers Very surprising for a budget device Overall Id recommend this tablet to anyone wants an affordable and capable device either for work or leasure I havent tried gaming on it but Im sure it would handle itself pretty well A great value but If this tablet goes on sale than its pretty much a no brainer Note Annoyingly this tablet doesnt a include a USBC charging brick I had to use my phone charger instead because the included charging cable was USBC to USBC I only own USBA bricks So be prepared >>><<< I love the tablet however the one I ordered from Amazon I had to return It was advertised as being the 5g model When I took it to my internet provider it did not have the correct chip holder for wifi operation I ended up getting the same tablet but with the correct chip card holder from my provider and returning the one to Amazon I wanted the new Samsung tablet especially for its 5g capabilities I figured out later that was probably why the Amazon one was a lot less in price Still a wonderful tablet And Amazon readily took back the original one >>><<< Im giving it a 4 out 5 stars because Im a be honest with you I HOPE THE WAY I WRITE THIS DOESNT MESS UP Pros Big Screen 90Hz Refresh Rate Not Adaptive Btw 1080p Quality 1920x1080 not changeable just FHD Big Battery Life Can Game but remember 64GB Storage 4GB RAM but 128GB Storage 8GB RAM Micro SD Card Up to 1TB I think u can put SIM Card too Maybe Has Samsung Dex To Turn it into a mini PC Has the 3 dots on the edge for keyboard and mouse Cheaper than the S Models of Samsung Tablets Cons TFT Panel Looks LCD to me but it doesnt have OLED Colors are not as good as OLED devices which is too be expected Charging Takes Long but last awhile just not sure what is the maximum fast charging it can take Maybe 20 watts Doesnt have SPen No 120Hz Refrest Rate Not ADAPTIVE 1120Hz No QHD 2560x1440p Viewing Angles are alright but you can notice the LCDTFT display always the blacks are not looking black instead its dark grayish Camera is okay still blurry >>><<< I upgraded from a Galaxy A8 and loving this tablet except for the current software bug effecting these A9 models There is an issue with the multipoint touch such as when pinch zooming or playing a game that involves 2 fingers touching at the same time It is very glitchy You kinda have to finesse the pinch zoom with a light touch and it will work If you dont play games and arent constantly using the pinch zoom function which most probably arent you will hardly notice the issue Though if you play games involving multitouch this will be a problem for you Strangely though if you plug corded headphones into the jack the problem stops really weird It does seem to just be a software bug though and Samsung should be able to fix the problem with an update patch Unfortunately little problems like this are just part of the technological world we live in now and occasionally happens to the devices we use and they need to be updated Other than that though This tablet feels nice and light runs fast and smooth with the upgraded processor and increased 8GB of RAM on the A9 model and the screen has a beautiful bright picture with nice deep and vibrant colors I did a side by side HD video comparison with my A8 and the picture on the A9 is quite a noticeable improvement And I see people saying that theres didnt come with a charger as if its a mistake It is not a mistake Samsung doesnt send chargers with their products anymore They say its to minimize their impact on the environment or whatever and also because I think they know most people have plenty of charging blocks and USB C cables laying around at this point being that so many products use them now and if you dont you can buy one very cheap With all that said if you can deal with the current multitouch problem until its fixed I high >>><<< My 2017 8 A8 is getting long in the tooth Ive had some software incompatibility show up Android 9 doesnt cut it anymore The battery is also starting to lose charge a bit The A9 has Android 14 and a new battery so those issues are gone Everything seems to work according to Samsungs usual high standards People in reviews seem to complain about slow charging Its 2024 folks My fast chargers have no problem charging it up in a few hours My one complaint is the size 11 inches is great for sitting on a desktop and viewing things but I have a television and a laptop for that I miss the old A8s 8 screen that allowed for comfortable handholding Alas even the new A8 is 10 inches I looked at other brands but Samsung was still the best bet >>><<< Bought for chef at restaurant I work at He photographs the dishes with the camera feature and the picture quality is awesome Whenever hes off the other chefs can use the tablet to reference the dish in question He also photographs new dishes and sends them to the owners to inquire on a possible new special >>><<< This tablet has been doing very well for me There is a transfer program built in that helps you step by step move your data from your old Samsung Galaxy Tab to this new one The processor is very good there is a plentiful amount of RAM and there still are ports you can plug into I got the HXCASEAC Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 A9 Plus Case 11 Inch and it is also the second time Ive bought this case Protective rubber and a built in screen protector Shamefully I was upgrading from a Tab 7 and probably wouldnt have done that if the batteries hadnt swollen and gotten hot But back to this tablet If youve had a Tab before worry not here things just got better The colors the feels its all there I purchased a 1TB MicroSD card and it has a home in this Tab 9 Beyond that Im not sure what I can say about this Tab oh yeah its from Samsung so its full of Samsung goodness >>><<< At first I was hesitant because being a tablet I always doubt if it will be good or not or if it will be fast But I must confess that this tablet has surprised me I bought it for my 5 year old son for his school work It is very fast lightweight with a friendly and updated operating system It met my expectations 100percent >>><<< I use my tablet constantly for playing games having virtual Doctors appointments online shopping and online banking It is very fast fastest Ive ever had actually and it is so easy to use I absolutely love how thin it is and lightweight Because a lot of them are super heavy for what they are I love that this has a 128 GB of storage Cause I can have any app that I have Heart set on and I dont have to worry about anything going over Or having backup storage You can also use a microSD card with it I have not needed to but I do own one if that is ever needed Overall This is the best tablet Ive ever owned and Ive owned a lot of different tablets over the years I love this more than my previous iPad And my previous Kindle HD 10 highly recommended 10 out of 10 >>><<< Ok so I originally tried the Amazon Fire because it claimed to be so awesome Im still waiting for the refund But this Samsung so far has been a jewel for me So far so good Very happy to have found this one for 10dollar less than the Fire that has no special features >>><<< I was looking around for a Samsung tablet and found a variety of them priced all over the place I ordered one for dollar79 and it ran out of memory very quickly I was constantly deleting photos and music in order to have enough memory for my apps I realized I needed something with a lot more memory I looked at some of the Samsung Tablets that cost as much as dollar800 before settling on the Samsung Tab A9 Its probably not as good as the top of the line Samsung Tablets but on the other hand it was only dollar199 and for that price its a bargain >>><<< We have has the A9 a couple days now We have each has Samsung tablets for several years We have liked them This one has features to love We have however spent more time with it on the charger than in our hands >>><<< Maybe my old tablet was just too old to not appreciate the evolution and trends of tablets in general but the screen on this tablet is so much nicer than what I had previously Definitely it has a speedperformance advantage as well >>><<< Best work tablet Ive had the only reason for taking off 1 star is the battery takes 2 or more hours to charge up from 30percent and it drains down to that in about 3 hours of use Thats with a brand name rapid charger and a high quality cable As others have mentioned the USB receptacle takes extra care to plug in firmly A small hassle but worth it to me for the overall performance >>><<< As far as Im concerned everything should be made by Samsung it is a great company the color is vivid ease operation touch works great put a cover on it in a safe screen high performance product great job >>><<< I bought this to use as an inexpensive tablet I could use while backpacking I was looking for something really basic that I could read at camp check maps and listen to music offline while hiking Being a Samsung it meant I would be able to find a decent case for it to provide at least some basic protection If it got damaged during the hike well it was a cheap tablet so it should be good enough It had 55percent battery when it arrived so I plugged it into a USBC cable I had plugged into the USB port on my wall outlet I figured this would be alright since it would need to be charged from a portable power source in the field anyway After 48 minutes it managed to charge only to 64percent I wanted to err on it being my cable so I plugged it into a USBC power brick instead and put that in my outlet My wall outlets are 20w and this requires 15w to charge so it should totally work It managed to hit 100percent 45 hours later Taking four and a half hours to charge anything 36percent is insane When I finally was able to power the tablet on the screen was so dim I could barely see anything After rushing through the typical Android setup I managed to increase the display brightness to around 50percent After installing 3 apps I noticed that the battery was at 93percent for less than a half hour of use I definitely do not recommend this tablet The cons far outweigh the pros in this device especially since finding a budget tablet is not really that hard to find these days >>><<< I bought this as a second tablet besides my S6 Lite I love it because of the bigger storage and the picture and sound quality are amazing The screen is several inches bigger than my S6 Lite but its not too big The only thing I didnt like was that it didnt come with the S Pen which I know it didnt but bought some capacitive stylus and problem solved Overall I am very happy with this tablet I will always stick to Samsung for phones air buds and tablets as they are hard to beat >>><<< This is supposed to be the lower end affordable tabletI honestly like it better than the more expensive flagship tablet I got my wife The speakers are phenomenal the picture is top shelf I highly recommend Also awesome it included headphone jack and SD card expansion up to 1TB >>><<< The lighter weight makes this tablet easier to use than my last Galaxy I really trust Samsung products they always have superior quality and ease of use Will buy again in future if need be >>><<< I got my tablet on Saturday I am very happy with 8t It was easy to set up Its fast Everything I needed is in this tablet So far I love my new tablet I recommend ordering this tablet for yourself >>><<< Ive always had the best Galaxy tablets the S series Thought Id try A series Verdict not quite as quick or sharp as S but overall satisfactory What youll notice most a little hesitation and jerkiness when you pinch or expand screen size with your fingers Works better when you resize a little slower and smoother Update on 3324 That hesitation and jerkiness when you use fingers to pinchexpand screen is worse than I thought its intolerable Im going to live with it for now but contrary to what I wrote I would not buy A9 again For dollar200 more I could have had the crispness speed and smooth functionality of the S9 >>><<< I purchased the Samsung Galaxy A9 8128 model and inputted a 128 GB Samsung SD card and am able to offset app space and downloads right to the card to conserve space I have had the tablet for a week and have no speed or input issues and visually the tablet itself is sleek I am using for work and have had no productivity issues sharing service and apps between my ZFold 3 I recommend purchase I shopped around for two months and am happy with my choice Will provide update in 6 months but anticipate no issues Battery lasts roughly 32 hours on full charge with mid to full use each day I am happy with that Fast charging is complete in 15 hours from 5percent Regardless research anyway and make the best choice for you >>><<< Very nice Samsung tablet lots of storage Big battery but can not be fast charged Last night I was at 27percent battery I plugged it in and this morning it was only on 83percent 7 hours S pen does not work on this tablet You can draw in Samsung notes but you cant write with a stylist Its a little too big for holding it But its great on a table or desk Over all a great tablet at a great price >>><<< Purchased another tablet but found it difficult for a tech challenged person to use This tablet was easy to set up and easy to use >>><<< I havent personally owned a tablet that I loved since the Nexus 7 which still bring back fond memories You cannot go wrong with this tablet buti have to be honest Im a samsung guy Another great product that I use for college and for my personal Bible study >>><<< The A9 is a good general use product It doesnt have a high res screen with OLED or 120Hz but it gets the job done I really appreciated the headphone jack and MicroSD card slot However I wish it had a fingerprint reader and frontfacing speakers The screen is sharp at this size but it dims noticeably off angle Luckily the battery charges quickly Also a case can be gotten on Amazon for under dollar500 >>><<< No issues so far i use this for bills and app i dont want on my phone everything i needed was available for download so thats a plus for me >>><<< The tablet fits my needs to a T Now you can 100percent notice its a 1080p resolution and 60hz refresh rate Its definitely a budget tablet but plays games no problem screen is nice and bright and the speakers sound pretty good If you dont mind the lower resolution and refresh rate then this is the best option for you >>><<< This tablet could be made by anyone There appears to be no external branding However it is all Samsung in its operation >>><<< I was promised a case with this product to no avail I called Amazon and they took 10percent off my purchased however now the tablet is selling for a great deal lower than what I paid for it terrible advertising the sound is very good with this tablet however the charging takes a very long time the battery life is mediocre I would return the product to get to get the product dollar50 cheaper but I dont want to go through all the trouble beware it does not come with a case thats the reason why I purchased it that and the sound quality >>><<< Extremely satisfied with my purchase bought this one to upgrade from Amazon fire 10 and glad I made the choice I like it better than any other tablet Ive had screen is a great size for less strain on the eyes >>><<< So far happy with the purchase installing and updating the applications Everything arrived perfectly by DHL >>><<< I love the tablet only complaint you need to send a compatible plug >>><<< Good quality and uses the same OS as my phones Transferring files was a BREEZE I would do business with this seller again >>><<< I use this every day its fast and glad I got it >>><<< I bought 2 tab from this seller the first one was brand new and saw how good it was I order a 2nd one for my niece the second one i got it was not brand new it had the sticker when you give a second chance an item I know and i remember well I order a new one not a used one I dont mind this but please state what one is ordering because i paid for a brand new item and it came in a bag >>><<< I did not receive the cover that came with the tablet according to the photo I received a cover that came with the glass but it did not arrive with the tablet >>><<< I love this tablet connected perfectly with my android Doesnt lag and so manyyyy features Get it >>><<< Tablet really nice but its static alot Takes a long time to startup and sometimes screen cannot be cleared I really miss my Samsung T820 Tablet its broken thats why i got this A9 but its lagging I should be returning shortlyexchanging >>><<< I had to replace my tablet ASAP and this was the upgrade This was dollar100 less than what I was going to pay at my retailer Exact same tablet It works great is a great size Great purchase Im so happy with this tablet >>><<< THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS VERY GOOD IT MEETS MY NEEDS AT THE MOMENT THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT THE SUPPLIER OFFERS THE BOOK COVER FOR FREE WITH THE PURCHASE FOR THE GRAPHITE COLOR AND IN THE END IT DOESNT BRING IT I STILL KEPT THE TABLET AND BUY A SEPARATE COVER >>><<< This tablet is nice Im very happy with it Does everything with no lagging and very nice >>><<< After a long long time my old Samsung 7 tablet finally conked out It was too slow and didnt have enough storage anyway I knew I was going to buy another Samsung but wanted a good deal I splurged and bought the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9 11 Tablet w 128GB of storage My God this is super FAST If you are watching a video its like having a small TV in your lap table or hand The speed and storage is incredible Plus lots and lots of new features since my old one Suggestion buy a screen protector and a cover to keep it like new >>><<< A little heavier than expected but not by much Other than that the best you can get at this range price >>><<< Its a Samsung A9 5G whats not to like no more wifi if I dont want connect to it in public locations Loaded software is more than adequate to do most all of your basic work or play music and videos needs will buy again >>><<< I returned due to I needed wireless service not just wifi >>><<< I mostly use it for Facebook in my library app to read books It works great and I love it >>><<< The tablet is very good it is large and for the price it is worth it for social networks and music and entertainment OK The sorrow >>><<< Very happy with tablet and case >>><<< I have been using this tablet for a few weeks and love it No glitches or delays Would purchase again >>><<< Received my tablet in 1day really not even 24hrs Opened the box connected with a QR on my phone and my setup was complete in less than 10 minutes So far our bonding is going well >>><<< Great tablet BUT it doesnt come with a charger that I was unaware of so if you going to buy this device make sure you buy a type C charger with it because it doesnt come with one It comes with the charger cord but not the charger adapter that you plug into the outlet >>><<< I like the big sceen and it being the A series for the budget price >>><<< Inexpensive easy to navigate works as intended >>><<< Like everything about this unit Sound system is incredibly perfect with 4 speakerscase for this tablet with its 11 screen is a tad difficult to find but is attainable here on Amazonjust pay CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SCREEN SIZEEZY TO M AKE MISTAKEFASTSAFEDELIVERYALL GOOD RAS24 >>><<< I bought so that I could use Smart View to Cast Dribbleup on to my Roku TV I tried lower versions but they either didnt have a high enough Android OS original not updated 12 which messes up the dribbleup sound or they didnt have SmartView software to wirelessly cast I boughtreturned about 3 samsungs before I found a good one and I didnt want a phone version just because it would have been too small without the TV So this worked The only thing is that I have to search for smartview when

nicely as a media device >>><<< This was a birthday present for my husband Its just what he wanted >>><<< I replaced my Lenovo with this I should have gotten Samsung in the 1st place >>><<< Works great and priced at a awesome price >>><<< Its perfect for what I wanted >>><<< This thing does everything I need and I love it Its very fast and has an memory to hold all the games I want to play >>><<< Memory good Battery has good life faster than Galaxy A tablet all streaming apps work well >>><<< I purchased a different tablet 2 years ago it was so slow I reset it to factory settings it was just useless LOL I did my research and all the fingers pointed by this And boy am I glad I did It was delivered to my house in like 2 days fantastic price and it has a speed as fast as a bullet I am so loving this tablet It absolutely does everything If I had an extra thumb Id give it three thumbs up LOL >>><<< Tab fits small organization or personal use perfectly >>><<< The tablet does the job The only draw back is the Super slow recharge speed And if youre looking for a good S pen at low price The CCIVV Stylus Pen 2 in 1 Fine Point Mesh Tip Stylus for Touch Screen Compatible for Tablet and Cellphone works great with the tablet >>><<< Have no complaints Great tablet >>><<< Nice >>><<< I really like this tablet Its fast the screen is big and clear Also since I have a Samsung phone it quickly moved all of my apps over to the tablet The sound also is really good I purchased it to mainly watch movies and stream shows from my apps So the clarity is good the sound is good Surfing the internet with WiFi has been quick also Quality and price cannot be beat >>><<< Bought this to work with my Cricut Joy able to link up >>><<< No complaints whatsoever Good size fits the hands well clear and sharp screen fast And the battery lasts forever I use it lightly for the record but it has been on for over 2 weeks and is still around 20percent battery >>><<< Versatile for kids homeworks >>><<< Fairly easy to copy everything from existing old Samsung tablet >>><<< I had a Fire tablet which was great but my cat decided to launch it off my dresser and the screen broke So this is my replacement I have a Samsung phone so this was a no brainer for me It does everything I need and allows me to be work productive >>><<< I ordered this tablet for my husband because his old one was getting really slow and he wanted to upgrade The new one was just what he wanted and its big enough for him to see with ease It was reasonably priced too >>><<< My husband has the earlier version of this tablet I would walk by and see him enjoying using it That said I really wanted it for music and solitaire and reading the news with these older eyes and just surfing for stuff Got it loaded it up took a whileand after 2 days of use asked myself what took you so long to get one Its wonderful The sound quality is amazing and the screen qualityperfect Went back for a really pretty girlie case to have it sit on my lap Who needs a apple Not me Thank you >>><<< Very happy with it >>><<< Ive only had the tablet for a little over a week but love it so far I wanted something smaller than the laptop for traveling and its perfect I was able to get all my apps loaded My kindle app has all my books I can manage my bills on this I can listen to music or even watch a movie Its lightweight after charging it the first time I didnt have to charge it again for 9 days So far its great >>><<< Ease setup perfect size Travel readyget the case and charger with it >>><<< Delivery on time good seller >>><<< This tablet is really big and runs smooth I have zero complaints the camera isnt the best of the best but who buys a tablet for the camera The performance battery life screen resolution are top notch You wont be disappointed I want to mention though that this is a WiFi only version of the tab A9 Plus so you cant use a physical SIM card nor an e Sim >>><<< Good size price and performance Wish the little setup leaflet had more explicit instructions If I were not a longterm Samsung and android user Im not sure setup would have gone well Overall I am satisfied and would recommend I have zero interest in games so cant speak to that aspect >>><<< I have had the A9 now for 10 days so I have got a good feel for it and as far as tablets under dollar250 this will be tough to beat I love the big screen that comes with it Its great for Netflix and YouTube or anything else like that You dont get 4K with this tablet but 1080 is more than good enough You get great audio and the battery life is exceptional On a full charge you get 2 days of use and thats with me heavily using it I recommend getting the 128 gb version of this tablet given its a tremendous value If you are use to using a laptop or a PC this tablet comes equipped with Samsung Dex which gives you that same look and feel so thats a big plus Overall its a really good tablet for the price that comes with a lot of bells and whistles you see with a expensive tablet I highly recommend >>><<< Excellent Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 with 64 GB quad speakersNetflix is now soundtasticthis upgrade was under dollar200 Awesome features and speed Also the easiest setup using the android Smart Switch that transferred data from my Samsung Tab A version 2017 to the Samsung Tab A9 version 2023woohoo Go Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 for an under

it >>><<< Its okay if youre just using it to tinker around on Battery isnt all that great I was on it for an hour and a half starting from 100percent and it is now 78percent My phone last longer than that I like Samsung thats what my phone is I just think they could have done better with this I think the price is a little to high for a 2023 and no more than what it is >>><<< ly recommend getting this tablet as everything else about it is great >>>\n",

with the floating windows Thank you for a response have a good day >>><<< I thank you for the good and detailed presentation of this video This tablet only interests me I have two questions to ask you First can you tell me if this tablet is compatible with HiFi sound Res so that I can listen to streaming music with Qobuz I obviously have headphones compatible with highresolution sound I saw that the tablet had a 35 jack socket although that is not the case in any case I can also send it via bluetooth My second question I would like to know if there is a lot of Bloatware on it as on their mobile phone I find it very restrictive I thank you in advance if you can give me answers to these questions See you JMC 13 >>><<< As long as you can stream properly with it that would be completely enough for me I dont need a tablet that costs euros500 or something >>><<< Would that be something for students or not >>><<< Is it worth switching from a Samsung a6 585 model from 2016 Widelive Level L3 >>><<< When I read reviews of such devices I always ask myself WHY would someone consume media Spend euros200 on an 11 inch tablet that can easily fall For the same price there is a 32inch smart TV eg for the childrens room or a refurbished Professional laptop with 14 or 156 inches that has x ports and is also great to use both brands And if there is a tablet for the kitchen should be one with T606 will do for half the price All three devices just mentioned do their job well in my household >>><<< Ive been using the tablet for a few days Complementary to desktop PC and smartphone Absolutely ok for my purposes Satisfied for under euros200 But Xiaomi customer service is uninformed If you dont dare to practice and try this device will sell quickly Information from the manufacturer is poor Seniors should book a VHS course immediately >>><<< And how long does it take to get updates >>><<< I use the Honor Pad x9 with 120Hz and 6 speakers for the same price great >>><<< I have A few months ago I treated myself to a 141inch tablet Nameless brand for 230 euros in a Chinese shop now under 200 euros The joy was shortlived Losing every word about it is a waste Its just crap in every respect Can be found on Amazon for 291 euros I was seduced by the size >>><<< I ordered the 4GB Redmi Pad today for euros149 we need it as a replacement for the TV in the kitchen I hope you think it will be enough for that >>><<< I mean I get the tablet for free since I got the Xiaomi 13 T so I cant complain >>><<< If you could get the tab for 50 euros less it would be a real nobrainer Thats like the Fire HD 10 for 80 euros The price is the deciding factor As a living room tablet for couch surfing streaming social media and light games it is easily sufficient But 200 euros is a bit too much for me personally >>><<< We bought the Remi Pad SE with 6 GB of RAM for around 200 euros and I cant confirm the performance statement We use this tablet in our bathroom as a media tablet with family software on it that recognizes who is currently logging in with which password and then opens the corresponding interface The tablet is more than enough for all social media YouTube games or even one or two emails and the thing doesnt have to be able to do anything more For those who are now triggered because we use it as a tablet in the bathroom still better than reading the newspaper Great video thanks for that >>><<< At first I wanted to buy the SE but then I stumbled across the normal Redmi Pad 4128 for the same price and bought that Advantages are the more powerful SoC Helio G99 also made in 6nm especially in the graphics area The internal memory is also faster because you get a UFS 22 connection With this SoC I can also play somewhat more complex games Dead Cells Honkai Star Rail and the memory connection is much faster with readingwriting at the same time Otherwise the two tablets dont have much in common One has a 35mm jack connection the other has a slightly better battery life But it is the advantages mentioned above that for me are the decisive reasons for the NONSE >>><<< I have the normal Redmi Pad and am absolutely satisfied Use it for streaming and social media Its absolutely enough for that >>><<< In the price range up to 200 euros there is usually not much more power 60 Hz and possibly LTE if you want more you have to pay more 300400 euros Xiaomi pad 5 or 6 Oneplus pad etc >>><<< If theoretically my daughter had needed a new tablet I might have taken a look at it but for us adults I would prefer to use Xiaomi >>><<< I got an original iPad 9th generation for euros200 on Black Friday >>><<< Nice >>><<< Everything in excellent condition >>><<< I love this tablet and the quality of audio is great >>><<< For me its better than another more recognized brand >>><<< I bought this tablet for my husband He like it but the resolution of screen is not vivid as my Samsung S2 The pro is the tablet is very light weight fast speed good for watching YT or movie from app and it has Netfix >>><<< This tab is exactly what my better half needed And for the money its a winwin >>><<< Very good team >>><<< Good value for the price Works great >>><<< GOOD >>><<< It does not come with a case or protection for the screen the >>><<< Its exactly as it looks like >>><<< It arrived in Peru super fast and arrived in perfect condition it arrived just like the description Good product >>><<< I bought this as a present for my parents All they do is youtube and Netflix and they absolutely love it they love how big the screen is they said its nice and bright with beautiful colours and very loud very good for mom to listen to youtube while she cooks or preps ingrediants They used to have a Samsung Note Tablet 101 inch so it was a very old tablet they upgraded from >>><<< Excellent quality price >>><<< I use it for surfing and it is completely sufficient Display and battery are very nice Also good Xiaomi quality >>><<< On the hardware side you cant complain plenty of RAM and storage The display is also good as is the sound Of course when it comes to advertising promises about gaming you have to make some compromises with everything that is 3D the graphics processor struggles solely with the very high screen resolution even with reduced rendering resolution and many graphics options at minimum somewhat complex Android systems run Title pixelated or with a few images per second It would be good to expect too much for the little money The own Android version still MIUI Pad Global currently 1405 is something very special to me You spend a long time looking for some options because they are simply somewhere else than on the standard Android Or not exist at all Some gestures are also very unique its easy to switch off But especially with such a large device 11 and 256GB of memory it would be nice if several family members could have their own Google accounts on the device But there is only the second profile which unfortunately doesnt work so well for additional children Unfortunately Xiaomi doesnt offer limited profiles like Samsungs which means its not a good tablet for families with children >>><<< Works great battery lasts a long time lets see how long that lasts >>><<< Fast but above all excellent video and audio >>><<< Very good value for money >>><<< large tablet The only negative point is MIUI 14 absence of HOME button and photo previews displayed in low resolution in Gallery Minimum settings essential Good sound quite powerful >>><<< I liked it a lot It is extremely functional I recommend it >>><<< I find it functional and practical It has good definition and I can see my messages well >>><<< The picture is really incredibly good At the beginning it is made clear how to operate it The circle and square at the bottom will no longer be visible However updating the Apps themselves does not happen automatically And Aptx is really great if you have equipment that can receive this Bluetooth NO AUDIOVIDEO from USBC a USBC hub is not an option for TV or DAC >>><<< Good tablet for a mediumlow range It doesnt seem subject to excessive heating In subsequent models the camera a little more would be enough for much better photos and the display need improvement Otherwise the performance is good even in split screen and with floating windows open >>><<< Unfortunately the price collapsed after a few weeks so that a better tablet from the Xiaomi brand could have been obtained for slightly more money >>><<< Money well spent Top quality >>><<< Purchase without problem >>><<< What is specified is fulfilled At first I thought that due to the cost perhaps they sent another device with a different storage capacity but once I had it at home I verified that it was as is It arrived in perfect condition includes tablet USB cable and charger Takes photos and videos well It has 4 speakers which sounds perfect Easy practical and simple movement I can read in it watch videos see my graphs it is excellent very satisfied with the purchase >>><<< Ordering and delivery worked great it was easy to set up even if you dont know much about it We use it to read the newspaper It has a nice image resolution so far we are very happy with it >>><<< Fast and reliable beautiful recommended design >>><<< It has been a very successful purchase Very light tablet fast and easy to operate >>><<< Perfect very happy >>><<< Really very disappointed Bought to specifically play certain games requiring GPS and the tablet contains no GPS chip An element that would perhaps be essential to point out in the description >>><<< The truth is that I was very surprised by the price I got it for It works very well for playing basic games the same for watching streaming or even for writing documents good battery performance I was surprised by how long the battery lasts which sometimes exasperates me because it takes more than an hour to charge to 100percent >>><<< At a low price lots of power Fast essential the battery has a remarkable life The screen is very sensitive but its a matter of getting used to it Sharp screen I dont have great needs but I can do what I have to do excellently >>><<< Excellent Tablet for the price it works great its battery consumption is very low and I never turn it off it holds up to work with good performance I guess the extra RAM helps it a lot The brightness of the screen is good the sound too I dont use it for games I use it for office automation and networks it has a wired headphone output which for me is the best although it is Bluetooth it works wonderfully >>><<< I bought it as a gift it comes perfectly packaged everything is fine at first glance >>><<< Quite useful for classes >>><<< Excellent pricequality ratio >>><<< I didnt look at the size and its bigger than I wanted but it works super well clear graphics excellent audio fluid so far so good >>><<< I liked that it doesnt jam everything runs very smoothly >>><<< About the seller He sent the product well packaged everything was correct and the invoice arrived in the email Delivery I placed the order on a Friday night and on Tuesday the product was already at my house About the Tablet SENSATIONAL I used it before and then came to evaluate it The battery has incredible durability 4 sound outputs it looks like a speaker the image is perfect and the system is super fast It has many functions I was on the fence between this one and the Samsung one but I dont regret it I chose the green color its a very soft and beautiful tone I hope I helped >>><<< Exceeded all my expectations >>><<< I loved it very good >>><<< Im going to make this review as I tried to find information when I was looking for a tablet I needed something to study so due to the configurations this tablet perfectly meets my needs I looked for the version with 8GB of RAM so it would be faster One piece of information that I find useful and that I hadnt seen before is that it has a split screen function so I can use YouTube and a writing app or other content at the same time I even added an image This makes it much easier for those who like to take notes The sound on this tablet is wonderful due to the four outputs and the screen also surprised me with its quality I made an excellent purchase Furthermore upon arriving in Brazil it was taxed and the seller promptly paid the fee very quickly >>><<< ok >>><<< I bought this tablet to use for studies and so far it has been perfect the customs fee was paid by the seller the delivery was good and I am very happy with my purchase >>><<< I bought the tablet on 0215 and it was delivered on 0304 in perfect condition I was charged Rdollar 6023 I paid the fee but sent the receipt to the seller who refunded the amount within 2 days on the card invoice and was very attentive in answering questions As for the tablet its very fast and doesnt crash Its very worth it >>><<< I loved the product it arrived within 22 days the tablet was taxed but the seller paid for everything correctly >>><<< I bought it for basic things and it works perfectly >>><<< It arrived exactly it took a week and a half to arrive I really liked it it was fluid Im still learning but I already love it >>><<< It arrived in perfect condition Ive had it for almost a month and I havent had any problems >>><<< Play Video The product arrived well ahead of schedule the sound is of high quality access to search pages is very good battery consumption varies depending on how you use it but Im liking the product I recommend >>><<< Play Video Its really worth it better than I expected >>><<< It is not approved by Anatel Theres a noise in the camera as if something had come loose It feels empty inside like hollow Did not like It slows down a bit the most demanding should look for a more advanced processor >>><<< It is an issue to be able to talk to the seller he does not give solutions and ignores the problem Do I recommend Xiaomi obviously yes Do I recommend the seller There are other options >>><<< Tablet is beautiful it was working normally until one day when turning on the device it turned on only half of the screen worked the other half turned on with a defect as shown in the photos and good video we were actually satisfied with the xiaomi tablet unfortunately it didnt last 1 month of use We took all the precautions we put an antiimpact cover on it it stayed on the desk the whole time it never fell or suffered impacts even so the product was defective we returned it to the seller so far the purchase has not been refunded we are waiting for a solution from the seller and also from Amazon Kind regards Carlson Macdo >>><<< Hes beautiful I liked everything about it It starts with the global version I didnt have any work The camera and sound work perfectly It takes a little while to load but nothing harmful Guys 10 points for the seller I had questions about delivery every time I asked a question I got an answer And everything is well explained It took a while to arrive but it arrived in perfect condition >>><<< It arrived exactly it took a week and a half to arrive I really liked it it was fluid Im
