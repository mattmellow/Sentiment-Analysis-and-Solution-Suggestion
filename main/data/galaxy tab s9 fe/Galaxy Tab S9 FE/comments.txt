My two-factor authentication phone number on Samsung account is the old one, and I couldn&#39;t pass the initial setup because of that. Spent several days, many hours with Samsung tech support, there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what, against their policy, which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what, ever.
