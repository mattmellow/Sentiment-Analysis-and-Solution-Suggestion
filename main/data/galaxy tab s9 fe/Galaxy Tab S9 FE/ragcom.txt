for anyone thinking about buying these Samsung tablets THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY Are good Yes But if it fails youll be ruined I bought a tab S9 fe within a short time 1 month it was defective There was no concert piece and no replacement tablet In this case Im still waiting for Samsungs goodwill What worries me is the following a newly manufactured tablet that no longer has spare parts

that the S6 lite is being discontinued does it become a good replacement Genuine question I want to know which one to buy since the S6 is coming out >>><<< I bought and returned S7 just recently The reason is ridiculous Samsung integrated a Samsung account into it and if you cant sign in into your Samsung account you cant pass the initial setup process which means you cannot use the tablet My twofactor authentication phone number on Samsung account is the old one and I couldnt pass the initial setup because of that Spent several days many hours with Samsung tech support there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what against their policy which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what ever So I couldnt complete the initial setup and had to return it Stupidity is on the next level >>><<< going Android is too much sacrifice lol >>><<< Have you heard of the xiaomi pad 6 max tablet 14 I wish you could do a review on that >>><<< iPad

and Samsung killer titles are super old click baits Everyone knows by now if you are an apple user you will get an iPad if you use Android you will get anything android starting with Samsung >>><<< I think people to for biggerscreebmn because bigger is more usable I like the form factor of smaller phones and devcies but really typing on tiny things kind of sucks >>><<< It cant be an ipad killer Actually all android pads features and powers are wasted What makes ipad good is its app store You can make the most of the iPads abilities because you have adobe apps Microsoft affinity photo and alot of good pdf reading apps like notability but android So what we actually need is more support from google i guess >>><<< how curious here in brazil a s9 ultra is way cheaper than an ipad pro I wonder why >>><<< I want that tablet >>><<< The tablet acrobat of juggernauts in the flat in you hand world is the s tab series razor thin and sharp strong connection is a phenomenal tablet when I say phenomenal I mean exquisite I Boasted over these tablets last year so I know this tablet is better but I might not get to experience it because there might be a Ten before I can get my hands on one so yes I agree that tablet does damage to the iPad but wait for ios and soc capability is pretty impressive due to the fact it will lock you out of the dawm device for a month and once you get it unlocked its like it was never locked I really cant say the same thing for Samsung s tab Because we know once its gone thats it so who cares its multitasking and customizability knocks that apple out of the tree also the UNIX lossy storage is very useful in certain use cases then you have expandable storage of s tab you just cant beat it thats it >>><<< Whats up everyone I hope this complete Tab

normal support external display With windows 10 >>><<< This Samsung tablet replaced an older Samsung tabS 10model I am a heavy user of my tablets so I decided to update to this newer model My older tablet was Amoled and though this one isnt I really dont notice the difference This one is a bit larger but I also prefer larger screens with my senior vision issues I play games like Township and Terra Nil which both work great on this tablet with the extra ram I mostly have quit using my lap top As I using this tablet all long watching utube and Netflix I decided that I needed to buy a more durable n protective case than the one that originally came with it just in case I dropped it Unfortunately I can no longer use the finger print sensorit is covered by the new case and the face recognition doesnt work that well for me My one change would be for Samsung to add finger print sensor to the screen as an option The charge holds most of the day for me with all day use but I will usually put it on the fast charger after about 6 hrs I like the battery safety feature that will stop it from over charging as that may have been a problem with my older tablet I always used some sort of stylus pens for my tablets but have never had a tablet that I could actually writedraw on and really didnt think that I needed that feature But it has proved very useful once I figured out how to use Samsung notes I dont think that I would ever buy another tablet without this feature as I have been able to eliminate most of my paper noteslove using this I havent used the pen to draw with but like to take notes on all my craft projects etc I can even insert photos into my notes My only wish was that I had this when I was in school many years ago though I would probably have ordered a smaller size for that purpose This large size is perfect for watching movie >>><<< This tablet is amazing Yes amazing I was coming from a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 11 inch And that thing was fasteven in present day But it got damaged in the field I use my tablet for business work Got the S9 FE I didnt want to buy another flagship S9 series because they were more expensive and for my needs the S9 FE served me wellIt is still smooth and quick Not quite as fast as the flagships but not slow or smooth Everything that I did on my S7 I am able to do here Only one issue I have with this tablet is that you cant plug it into an external monitor which I could before on my S7 But other that that this tablet is amazing and I highly recommend to anyone who wants most of the premium features of the flagship tablets but dont want to spend the cost for those >>><<< Updates will be posted on the top Update 3 120723 My FE just got Android 14 with UI 60 Quick download and install no problems Update 2 103023 I noticed one reviewer said they cant stream to their projector with this tablet as it runs slow One thing I noticed about this tablet and it is probably more the software is that out of box it appears apps are default set to run in the strict power saving mode i accidently noticed this when I had trouble audio streaming via an app So I changed the power saving mode to optimizzed and everything worked fine Update 1 101923 I charged the device from 19percent to 85percent Samsungs recommended limit using the Samsung 45watt charger It took 50 minutes The same charge on my Tab A8 takes about 325 hours It came a day early The packaging was excellent I also have a Tab A7 and Tab A8 I purchased the Tab S9 FE 109 to replace the Tab A7 which stopped Android updates with Android 12 I also purchased Samsungs 45watt charger The battery was at 51percent I charged it to 91percent I didnt watch the clock so I dont know exactly how long it took but it was quick I then used Samsung Flow used be Samsung Switch to copy my apps and data from the Tab A8 The Tab S9 came with a cable to I was able to use the wired method for the copying it went pretty quick All the apps except two copied One for some reason is not compatible with the S9 The other I was able to install from Google Play After that I spent a Few hours organizing my home screen with Microsoft Launcher and signing in and testing my music apps The audio is okay but when I connected the tablet to one of Sound Core BluetoothSpeakers I had to turn the volume down to under 25percent The S9 FE is definitely faster than the Tab A8 At one time I had about a half dozen apps open without a problem The >>><<< The tablet is amazing It really charges quickly and holds the charge for an extended period of time The camera is wonderful I will use it on any trips that I take I got a zipped covering for it with a strap I want to use it esp for panoramic pictures that will be in the making Highly recommend >>><<< Im an engineering major and I used this for notetaking I love the size and weight and the price is a lot more reasonable than an iPad Great battery life and it never got too hot Unfortunately the os is the dealbreaker for me Comes with a free copy of Goodnotes pro but the android version is slow glitchy and has way less features than the iOS version There are way fewer apps available for Android and the ones that are available are pretty clunky samsung notes has a lot of great features but is missing some major ones ie page layout and font customization Maybe in a few years Android will catch up but as of now the Android app experience just cant compete with iOS >>><<< The tablet is slightly larger than my previous one but quite a bit heavier probably the larger battery Nice screen Performance is good Very pleased with my purchase >>><<< Great for drawing watching movies ECT sounds decent love the operating system Screen shows very clear I Just put sim card in it an it activated its self Very thin pen is decent size not skinny I LOVE IT >>><<< I love the fact i can run any two apps in multiwindow mode with ease including ones otherwise memory hogging lol I cannot say enough good about this tablet dont know what to say so i will state my only gripe It wont connect to wifi 5g speeds Meaning I have a 500mbs connection but never get more than 350mbs on the tablet two feet from the router On my computer 3 rooms away i get 450525mbs Why is this It may be the norm for tablets and phones not sure I definately recommend this tablet especially for multitasking >>><<< I was so excited to try this tablet for my art as Android has a ton of things that make for an efficient workflow including air gestures with the SPen Pro not included air actions DEX mode syncing with my Windows computer and so much more The mint color is gorgeous and I loved everything about the tablet except that it couldnt do the ONE thing I bought it to do It worked fine at first but then I noticed there was an extreme delay in gestures when switching from pen to gesture and sometimes just wouldnt work at all This happened in my Clip Studio app as well as others I spent hours with support for the tablet and with CSP before being forced to factory reset which somehow solved it Until I installed the updates Turns out the issue is with OneUI and hasnt been resolved for years according to the complaints on Reddit dating back to 2022 This delay completely interrupts my workflow as I can not seamlessly switch from drawing with the pen to zooming or rotating with my hand I had returned the first tablet I got under the direction of the support desk only to get a second one spend hours reinstalling my brushes on CSP only to find the same problem Its definitely an issue with OneUI For everyone else who doesnt care or who doesnt intend to use it for art its 100percent fantastic Bright screen powerful budget tablet that can do so much more than you think it can For artists I am so sad to claim defeat to the iPad which can do the one thing this one can not Work The straw that broke the camels back for me is more of an issue with Clip Studio Paints Android version which does not allow you to access your files in ANY other way except through the cloud making it absolutely impossible to batch move your files from your tablets CSP to your desktop external HD or other devices You li >>><<< Too soon to say anything about battery life or value or durability Stupid things to aske me to rate after owing it for less than a week All I can say is that it works and the Samsung feature to transfer apps and data from an older tablet also worked I did have to spend maybe 4 hour on the line with Samsung tech support due to their Catch22 2 factor authentication It seems that if you dont have a textable smart phone and I dont you can only do the REQUIRED 2factor authentication via pregenerated PINS BUT you can only generate the PINS if you have already passed 2factor authentication which needs a smart phone Are you with me They do not offer sending a voice message with the secret onetime use PIN to a phone Noooooo Only text messaging will do This is absurd and exceptionally inconvenient Grrr to Samsung >>><<< Bought refurbished version but it was still pretty good A nice step up from the junky tablets under dollar200 Will say that I expected it to have a SIM card slot since its supposed to be 5G capable but the card insert didnt have a place for it Its also pretty good for digital art drawing with the Samsung pen with great response time though I have not tested it with anything else Used Ibis paint app with it Would highly recommend a case that holds the pen securely as it can be easy to lose or damage it and I doubt the Spen is cheap to replace All in all seems like a solid tablet and ya wont break the bank like ya would with an iPad >>><<< I owned a Tab A7 for a couple of years and the battery started expanding pushing the screen outwards Time to purchase a new tablet before it started a fire Decided on the Samsung Tab S9 FE and have not regretted it So much faster and a much bigger screen with a vivid display Only drawback is its a bit on the heavy side >>><<< It is a very good option I have been using it for 3 months work student and personal it is an excellent tablet it does not lock it runs almost everything my only complaint is that in the description it indicated that it came with the protector and that is a lie the tablet only comes for a few days I used it without a protector but it is better with its protector it gives security and the original comes with the pencil protector which is brilliant >>><<< Love the tablet Perfect for a digital artist Screen is sensitive for the S pen so perfect for drawing Not many updates during shipping so hard to know where it was or when to be around to sign for it Delivery lady was on time and friendly once the delivery time actually updated Tablet DID NOT come with the book cover case that was listed in included compenents in the ad They couldnt do anything about it unless I sent the whole thing back and couldnt just send me the book cover or a small credit to turn around and buy my own Disappointed with that Good tablet though >>><<< Samsung makes great products and this is one however I needed to return it because I got one that better suited my needs When I returned it I had to pay dollar2 for a label then they also subtracted dollar1250 for shupping from my return >>><<< Got the item it was well packaged to get out very nice product so far happy just trying to figure out the insurance that Im the extra insurance that I bought to cover it thats all >>><<< Arrived early was fine packaged correctly everything has worked as it should no problems at all >>><<< This is a great tablet but I needed it for a small business start up and not for everything I needed it for I was having issues with everything i loaded on it It might not have been the tablet just me >>><<< I loved the tablet it works quickly it is useful for what I need but my only complaint is that it does not work to project to HDMI which is terrible Im a teacher and I thought I could use it to present in class but that wasnt the case >>><<< I have received the tablet today and it just looks beautiful and perfectly for a student I will definitely recommend >>><<< I liked it because my daughter a medical student makes it easier for her to study consult entertain and communicate >>><<< Big improvement from my Fire HD 10 Fast and I really like the compatibility with my phone and laptop >>><<< I purchased 2 of these for my wife and I We used them on a LONG flight to New Zealand from Texas We was about to download a lot of shows to watch and never had to charge them from start to finish 16 hours flight >>><<< This tablet is everything I was looking for It is resistant fast the touch is fantastic the screen has excellent resolution the functions with the pen are the best and the response is fast there is no delay It met all expectations >>><<< Im loving my new tablet It was easy to setup and use >>><<< Performance So far its been able to handle anything I do without many problems Im able to use large 4000px canvas sizes on multiple drawing apps wo any lag or crashing Simple editing on 4k videos also isnt a problem But weirdly the one thing it struggles on is screen mirroring Itll disconnect or even out right crash sometimes it happens often enough that Ive stopped using it completely Battery I only charge up to 85percent and I still spend 10 hours drawing with music on in the background without power saving on The charging is also pretty fast Other I wish the s pen was more comfortable drawing or writing with it is painful for long periods it needs a grip The oem nib is ok but a textured screen protector metal nib feels necessary for drawingwriting >>><<< Hello this review is to mention that I am very happy with the product but as I understood the cover came in the purchase but in the box there was no gift cover luckily I came up with the idea of adding a separate generic cover but it is wrong that the product that includes the cover appears in the images when it is not >>><<< Im a teacher and was looking for something good and inexpensive to use to write on PDF of assignments and test It is simply amazing I love it the SPen is amazing and the Battery Life too Drawing is one of my hobbies so its also really awesome at that too >>><<< Its a very nice tablet I am really enjoying using it >>><<< Perfect function and nice image >>><<< Will be getting one for my daughter >>><<< Very satisfied I loved it >>><<< I bought this to be used as a digital planner I didnt need the fancy stuff and I thought it was too big for my needs as a teacher I decided to go with the smaller version the 109 because of the price as well If you are using this for gaming than this is for you Otherwise the smaller one does what I needed and I am happy that I returned this for the smaller version >>><<< I needed a new tablet since my other one had a UI System notification come up The system was going out after 4 years This tablet is fast and battery life on it lasts I play games music videos run cameras and take credit card payments on it throughout each day Like any other device the more you use it the more the battery drains Im usually on it full force for 6 to 7 hours before it lets me know my battery is at 15percent Im at 5059 at clearing my apps when I switch from one to the other I keep a charger next to me all day and I could get more out of the battery if I was more picky about it The pen works very well too Ive noticed I use the pen more on this tablet than any other tablet Ive had prior I got the 256gb on this one and surprisingly enough I havent had to delete stuff to make more room If it had calling and texting on it permanently I would be on the tablet more than my phone I mainly use it on the homes wifi so no need to spend an extra dollar27 for service on the tablet If I need wifi connected on this tablet I just connect it to my cell phone All our phones have unlimited everything so it pays to use it >>><<< Im sure the battery life would be better IF I didnt play games on it so much most of the day Otherwise its a fabulous tablet I just wish they gave me a charging cable instead of the type C to type C cable to switch apps etc What a waste of space in the box since I can do that over Wifi I really did not need that cable I NEED a charging cable Why would they sell something without a way to charge it Extra Makes me think batteries not included Come on Samsung You can DO BETTER Still love the tablet though >>><<< What is shido >>><<< El Performance >>><<< Excellent fast shipping just what I ordered >>><<< I also have the s9 ultra But wanted something smaller to take with me It is everything its larger brother is but in a smaller profile It is fast and picture quality fantastic I like the size at 109 inch Also 5g for Verizon >>><<< Very nice fits perfectly love it >>><<< The product is in excellent condition with the characteristic quality of Samsung but in the description it is mentioned the factory case that came as an accessory in the box along with the cable and the original SPEN but when reviewing the protective case factory for the tablet was not there having been mentioned >>><<< The tablet is very good and everything But I thought the case was already included in that version and apparently not I still highly recommend it a good tablet >>><<< I am so glad I got Samsung tablet instead of IPads limitations Works as expected good picture excellent computing speed no crashes and expansion memory capacity 1 terabyte intalled work seamless with my phone I am able to answer my phone emails text messages from my tablet even it has no phone line installed GREAT to edit my photos anywhere if I am connected to wifi >>><<< I look to Samsung first for the most robust and dependable and utilitarian electronics May not be as artsy as some others but thats not what I use them for >>><<< The size of the tablet 125 provides plenty of space to view any kind of documents There is a split screen feature that takes advantage of the extra viewing space The tablet is much easier to hold if you have a case for it Due to its size it can be awkward to hold without a case The processing speed is very good Downloading is very quick Battery life is adequate >>><<< Very easy to set up even for an 81 year old lady Has more features than I will ever use I love the SPen It is a real great feature I am a Samsung Lady Have been using their products cell phone TV Tablet washing machine etc for a long time and always find they fit my needs Very dependable Highly recommend this tablet >>><<< I bought this to my son to replace a Samsung tablet from 2017 that was struggling pretty hard with games like roblox and minecraft I have to say that Im very impressed with this tablet even considering it doesnt have a Snapdragon on it Everything we have thrown at it has worked without any problems without lowering the gaming experience and or performance The speakers are also very good for what the tablet costs I have an iPad Pro M1 and honestly I found the volume and sound quality to be on par or very close to the iPad The screen is crispy and smooth with good definition contrast and clarity Very happy with this tablet and needless to say my son is very very pleased with it >>><<< Good display Very good battery life Good range on wi fi compared to other devices I have owned Screen slightly shiny for book reading but not a significant issue >>><<< Its worth buying >>><<< Very nice tablet I use to read my books Very easy to set up just transferred data automatically from my Galaxy phone Sort of like a big phone Only negative charging cord did not have a wall adapter >>><<< Great product No issues and very useful >>><<< This tablet is just amazing The screen deliver great colours the sound really immersive when watching a movie Light so you can carry it everywhere easily The touchpen is great The best tab for me >>><<< This is the first product that i have owned in which the battery life is really 18 hours I would charge my Tablet every 3 days The picture quality is average and something that i really wish was better >>><<< Excellent tablet without a doubt I only dont give 5 stars because in the specifications it said that it came with a booktype protector which never arrived I had to buy one separately >>><<< It was hard to buy this to me expensive device I use my 2019 A tab all day long even though I have a very nice desktop computer and a fancy S22 ultra phone I read write research play stupid games shop watch videos access my printer do everything with it iIt cant stay connected to wifi 6 ane wont restart correctly Some sites were not rendering correctly So time for a new tablet It seemed like complete overkill to buy this tablet Dont you think so But it is a gift that I was encouraged to accept We had a lot of AMEX reward dollars that made it easier to buy now that Amazon accepts them I was again encouraged to get this big size It is pretty big Is that necessary I doubt it So far it runs well It magically linked with my phone and now is a second phone Along with my Samsung watch See I told you too much stuff To me it charges very slowly A full charge lasts a long time I am slow to get used to new things but I think I like this device Maybe there was a tablet priced between the Tab A and this one Ok this is the one between the tab A and the S9 tab I get it I like that it is water resistant but I never dunked the old Tab A I bet this new tablet will be dollar200 off in six weeks Oh well >>><<< My son wanted this to help him take notes in his college engineering classes Hes super excited about it and loving it so far >>><<< Tablet does everything I need it to it is replacing my iPad Air2 from 2015 since iOS 15 crippled the still useful thing It is now relegated to my content machine I use this for work where I pair to my phone for emails messaging and network sites and PDF viewing I work in aviation >>><<< I bought it for work design and so far so good its a good piece of equipment >>><<< Very useful practical perfect size and weight Super recommended I arrive very quickly >>><<< It has tons of real estate upgradeable memory via MicroSD up to 1TB it is thin and lightweight >>><<< Very good product >>><<< Excellent condition I got it at a good price >>><<< Work and home >>><<< I love it very much beautiful >>><<< I wanted a big screen and this was perfect runs smooth and connected to my phone so easy >>><<< Great product through and through >>><<< My wife and I each got one of these All the processing power and storage we need for daily internet browsing Colorful screen Speakers are adequate Large screen compared to 101s I have had before >>><<< I say this tablet is excellent plus really good at reasonable price great for those people dont had money buy or dont wanted spend 800 900 or 1000 dollars for tablet It had some features like full flagship tablet of Samsung tab s9 it had dex mode which can use like a laptop come with s pen the speakers are loud enough watch videos and movies Tab s9 fe also had fingerprint Censor I Like how samsung give us options buy different colors of tab s9 fe unlike tab s9 only came with 2 color options Camera are good enough to take pictures and recording videos Samsung galaxy tab s9 fe is water dust resistant so dont had worry about when it raining or getting dust on your tablet basically take with you everywhere There 5g options for this tablet now can Down side with tablet there no snapdragons chip inside of tab s9 fe at least samsung Optimize their chip so wont overheat y The tablet Yet dont mind some Sacrifice of the features still worth buying >>><<< I like that I can take notes on this tablet and save it across all my Samusung Devices to review later >>><<< Good tablet definitely better on my eyes than my older 8 inch tablet I thought when I was researching this tablet that it supported wifi 6 but that is not the case I have wifi 6 turned on and this tablet is unable to see it Too bad but still a nice tablet though I wish I could have bought it without the S pen that I will never use Okay so it looks like it does support wifi 6 as there is a little 6 next to the wifi symbol but it does not support wifi 6E 6ghz band I bought a USB wifi 6E adapter and that worked as it should and detected the 6ghz band >>><<< I loved it For the price it is an excellent tablet everything has worked very well >>><<< I have nothing but good to say about my new tablet Its everything I wanted and was easy to set up >>><<< Screen isnt crazy good but its fine >>><<< very nice >>><<< I love the keyboard has large alphabet and numbers Makes it so easy for me >>><<< The size is perfect for reading books and the battery lasts a long time >>><<< It has worked perfectly for me I use it to edit photos and videos and it does it without any problem I also use it in my IT work and it is super versatile and it has served as a second monitor to present information in an easier and more fluid way Its a shame that it doesnt have video output because its USB 20 but with screen share something is done Fully recommended although if you have a little more dollardollardollar the FE or the S9 would be better >>><<< Works great the pen attaches in more than one spot which a love I have had no issues with it Took it on a road trip battery lasts a long time which is nice Make lists and do homework on it >>><<< Slick Easy on the eyes and the wallet >>><<< Says whats in the box Tablet Cover Case Never got it But absolutely love the tablet Recommend 1010 >>><<< Box contents Smart book cover The case did not arrive it is advisable to check the items better before being sent >>><<< Play Video Excellent product a little dissatisfied with the poor protection of the merchandise they can improve itThank you anyway >>><<< I got this for my 11yr old son for his birthday it was delayed for a week but finally came and is running great >>><<< I really have been enjoying my new tablet I wanted something with a pen so I can do more digital notes for various things like school and genealogy So far it has been good Be careful with the pin number I didnt realize samsung erases everything if the pin code is forgotten So now Ill probably have to factory reset and lose all my notes >>><<< Love it still learning more about the features >>><<< I wanted to get a tablet to use for sheet music and replace my binder of paper sheets It was very easy to start and set up So far no issues I which it came with a wall charger which I had to buy separately >>><<< Display is crisp and very clear colors on screen are very vivid Processors are very fast for all of the tasks I ask of it One speaker on each end equals very nice sound The OS upgraded to Android 14 One UI 60 immediately upon plugging it into my wireless network The OS takes up 1528GB of space Even after loading all of my apps I still have 97GB of free space It is heavier than my 4 year old Galaxy Tab A 101 2019 but I can still hold it with one hand for quite a while before fatigue sets in I view this tablet as a very nice computer for the dollardollardollar I spent on it I believe I made a better choice than picking the Galaxy Tab A9 Without a cover it can be a little slippery >>><<< Very good tablet >>><<< personal use very good product >>><<< Samsung S9fe is a good reasonably priced 109 tablet I got the 256gb and installed a 512gb micro sd card So I have plenty of space My only complaint is that theres no case available except directly from Samsung Amazon has been out of stock for a while I do like the Spen its a real benefit I have swollen fingers its also a large enough circumference to hold comfortably All in all Im pleased The data transfer from my old A7 to this went smoothly I used the provided cable to connect both together and almost everything transferred thats simply a extremely minor annoyance 2 games All in all Im a happy camper >>><<< These work great Theyre a little dark but its OK that you have to try to read the business card inside because nobody needs to see it until they really need to see it >>><<< I like all of the features but the wifi range is slower than my S23 cellphone >>><<< Recommended I would buy it again >>><<< Its excellent for media and study the display has good colors >>><<< Excellent The screen is big >>><<< It does everything I want it to do I was able to connect it to my phone using Bluetoothtethering and it works well >>><<< Im not a Samsung fan but my best tablet ever even better than iPad I recommend it >>><<< While its not built for gaming it does handles all other things efficiently >>><<< Well worth the dollardollardollar Had purchased a Chromebook 2 360 and couldnt get it to connect or sync Contacted Samsung directly actually found out difference between tablet and laptop and this tablet is AMAZING Zero problems connecting and setting up Very easy and quick Also ordered the Samsung Keyboard Case Cover Screen Protector Cant say enough very impressed and its expandable and yes it syncs immediately with your phone and other products Thank you >>><<< I like its practicality and design Especially for students this is a must get >>><<< s and playing games at home If this tablet lasts as long as my older Samsung I will be very pleased >>><<<  extra 4 in the display over the A8 is nice The tablet is definitely bright enough I am keeping the brightness settings at about 10percent I havent tried any games since I dont play them I did check the download and upload speed and it was basically the same as the Tab A8 which is fine for me As far as the OS goes It came with Android 13 and Samsung UI 511 However the Android security update was Aug 1st I imagine it will update soon enough Google Play was June 2023 It took three restarts to bring it up to September which is a Google issue That is it for now I will post an update or two to this once I get more battery and other information Another excellent product from Samsung >>><<< terally have to manually open each file from the cloud onto desktop then save it where you want Or you have to access the files ONE at a time through the cloud click an arrow open the file location cut the file and paste it where you want And of course the file location doesnt have ALL your images in one place it places it within 3 tiers of foldiers for each individual file So after going through 2 tablets hours of support blood sweat and tears I finally have to call it quits on the Samsung Tablet yet again and switch to the 2x more expensive iPad Im so devastated >>>
