patsweb,"This Samsung tablet replaced an older Samsung tabS 10""model. I am a heavy user of my tablets, so I decided to update to this newer model. My older tablet was Amoled, and though this one isn't, I really don't notice the difference. This one is a bit larger, but I also prefer larger screens with my senior vision issues. I play games like Township and Terra Nil, which both work great on this tablet with the extra ram. I mostly have quit using my lap top. As I using this tablet all long, watching utube and Netflix, I decided that I needed to buy a more durable n protective case than the one that originally came with it, just in case I dropped it. Unfortunately, I can no longer use the finger print sensor(it is covered by the new case), and the face recognition doesn't work that well for me. My one change would be for Samsung to add finger print sensor to the screen as an option.

The charge holds most of the day for me with all day use, but I will usually put it on the ""fast charger"" after about 6 hrs. I like the battery safety feature that will stop it from over charging, as that may have been a problem with my older tablet.

I always used some sort of stylus pens for my tablets, but have never had a tablet that I could actually write/draw on and really didn't think that I needed that feature. But, it has proved very useful once I figured out how to use Samsung notes. I don't think that I would ever buy another tablet without this feature, as I have been able to eliminate most of my paper notes...love using this! I haven't used the pen to draw with, but like to take notes on all my craft projects, etc. I can even insert photos into my notes. My only wish was that I had this when I was in school many years ago, though I would probably have ordered a smaller size for that purpose. This large size is perfect for watching movies and playing games at home. If this tablet lasts as long as my older Samsung, I will be very pleased.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2024"
villanova,"This tablet is amazing!! Yes amazing. I was coming from a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 11 inch. And that thing was fast,even in present day. But it got damaged in the field. I use my tablet for business work. Got the S9 FE. I didn't want to buy another flagship (S9 series) because they were more expensive and for my needs the S9 FE served me well.It is still smooth and quick. Not quite as fast as the flagships, but not slow or smooth. Everything that I did on my S7, I am able to do here. Only one issue I have with this tablet is that you can't plug it into an external monitor, which I could before on my S7. But other that that this tablet is amazing and I highly recommend to anyone who wants most of the premium features of the flagship tablets, but don't want to spend the cost for those.","Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2024"
John Galt 2021,"Updates will be posted on the top.

Update #3 12/07/23
My FE just got Android 14 with U.I. 6.0 Quick download and install no problems.

Update #2 10/30/23

I noticed one reviewer said they can't stream to their projector with this tablet as it runs slow. One thing I noticed about this tablet, and it is probably more the software is that out of box it appears apps are default set to run in the ""strict power saving"" mode. i accidently noticed this when I had trouble audio streaming via an app. So, I changed the power saving mode to ""optimizzed' and everything worked fine.

Update #1 - 10/19/23.
I charged the device from 19% to 85% (Samsung's recommended limit) using the Samsung 45-watt charger. It took 50 minutes. The same charge on my Tab A8 takes about 3.25 hours.

It came a day early. The packaging was excellent.

I also have a Tab A7 and Tab A8. I purchased the Tab S9 FE 10.9"" to replace the Tab A7 which stopped Android updates with Android 12.

I also purchased Samsung's 45-watt charger. The battery was at 51%. I charged it to 91%, I didn't watch the clock so I don't know exactly how long it took but it was quick. I then used Samsung Flow used be Samsung Switch to copy my apps and data from the Tab A8. The Tab S9 came with a cable to I was able to use the wired method for the copying. it went pretty quick.

All the apps except two copied. One for some reason is not compatible with the S9. The other I was able to install from Google Play. After that I spent a Few hours organizing my home screen with Microsoft Launcher and signing in and testing my music apps. The audio is okay but when I connected the tablet to one of Sound Core Bluetooth-Speakers I had to turn the volume down to under 25%.

The S9 FE is definitely faster than the Tab A8. At one time I had about a half dozen apps open without a problem. The extra .4"" in the display over the A8 is nice. The tablet is definitely bright enough, I am keeping the brightness settings at about 10%.

I haven't tried any games since I don't play them. I did check the download and upload speed and it was basically the same as the Tab A8 which is fine for me.

As far as the OS goes. It came with Android 13 and Samsung U.I 5.1.1. However, the Android security update was Aug 1st. I imagine it will update soon enough. Google Play was June 2023. It took three restarts to bring it up to September which is a Google issue.

That is it for now. I will post an update or two to this once I get more battery and other information.

Another excellent product from Samsung.","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023"
Ann,The tablet is amazing. It really charges quickly and holds the charge for an extended period of time. The camera is wonderful. I will use it on any trips that I take. I got a zipped covering for it with a strap. I want to use it esp. for panoramic pictures that will be in the making. Highly recommend!!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2024"
Kat B.,"I'm an engineering major and I used this for note-taking. I love the size and weight and the price is a lot more reasonable than an iPad. Great battery life and it never got too hot. Unfortunately, the os is the dealbreaker for me. Comes with a free copy of Goodnotes pro but the android version is slow, glitchy and has way less features than the iOS version. There are way fewer apps available for Android and the ones that are available are pretty clunky; samsung notes has a lot of great features but is missing some major ones, i.e. page layout and font customization. Maybe in a few years Android will catch up, but as of now the Android app experience just can't compete with iOS.","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2024"

Andy Fox,"I love the fact i can run any two apps in multi-window mode with ease, including ones otherwise memory hogging, lol. I cannot say enough good about this tablet, dont know what to say so i will state my only gripe: It wont connect to wifi 5g speeds. Meaning I have a 500mbs connection but never get more than 350mbs on the tablet two feet from the router. On my computer 3 rooms away, i get 450-525mbs. Why is this??? It may be the norm for tablets and phones, not sure. I definately recommend this tablet especially for multitasking.","Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2024"
Anon,"I was so excited to try this tablet for my art, as Android has a ton of things that make for an efficient workflow including air gestures (with the S-Pen Pro, not included), air actions, DEX mode, syncing with my Windows computer, and so much more. The mint color is gorgeous, and I loved everything about the tablet... except that it couldn't do the ONE thing I bought it to do.

It worked fine at first, but then I noticed there was an extreme delay in gestures when switching from pen to gesture, and sometimes just wouldn't work at all. This happened in my Clip Studio app as well as others. I spent hours with support for the tablet and with CSP before being forced to factory reset, which somehow solved it... Until I installed the updates.

Turns out, the issue is with OneUI, and hasn't been resolved for years according to the complaints on Reddit dating back to 2022. This delay completely interrupts my workflow, as I can not seamlessly switch from drawing with the pen, to zooming or rotating with my hand.

I had returned the first tablet I got, under the direction of the support desk, only to get a second one, spend hours re-installing my brushes on CSP, only to find the same problem. It's definitely an issue with OneUI.

For everyone else who doesn't care, or who doesn't intend to use it for art, it's 100% fantastic. Bright screen, powerful budget tablet that can do so much more than you think it can.

For artists? I am so sad to claim defeat to the iPad which can do the one thing this one can not: Work.

The straw that broke the camel's back for me is more of an issue with Clip Studio Paint's Android version which does not allow you to access your files in ANY other way except through the cloud, making it absolutely impossible to batch move your files from your tablet's CSP to your desktop, external HD, or other devices. You literally have to manually open each file from the cloud, onto desktop, then save it where you want. Or you have to access the files ONE at a time through the cloud, click an arrow, open the file location, cut the file and paste it where you want. And of course the file location doesn't have ALL your images in one place. it places it within 3 tiers of foldiers for each. individual. file.

So after going through 2 tablets, hours of support, blood sweat and tears, I finally have to call it quits on the Samsung Tablet yet again and switch to the 2x more expensive iPad. I'm so devastated.","Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2024"
L. Goldstein,"Too soon to say anything about battery life, or value, or durability. Stupid things to aske me to rate after owing it for less than a week.

All I can say is that it works and the Samsung feature to transfer apps and data from an older tablet also worked. I did have to spend maybe 4 hour on the line with Samsung tech support due to their Catch-22 2 factor authentication. It seems that if you don't have a textable smart phone (and I don't) you can only do the REQUIRED 2-factor authentication via pre-generated PINS. BUT .... you can only generate the PINS if you have already passed 2-factor authentication, which needs a smart phone. Are you with me? They do not offer sending a voice message with the secret one-time use PIN to a phone. Noooooo. Only text messaging will do. This is absurd and exceptionally inconvenient. Grrr to Samsung.","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024"
Dar,"Bought refurbished version but it was still pretty good. A nice step up from the junky tablets under $200.

Will say that I expected it to have a SIM card slot since it's supposed to be 5G capable but the card insert didn't have a place for it.

It's also pretty good for digital art drawing with the Samsung pen with great response time, though I have not tested it with anything else. Used Ibis paint app with it.

Would highly recommend a case that holds the pen securely as it can be easy to lose or damage it, and I doubt the S-pen is cheap to replace.

All in all seems like a solid tablet and ya won't break the bank like ya would with an iPad.","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2024"
Yadda Yadda,"I owned a Tab A7 for a couple of years and the battery started expanding, pushing the screen outwards. Time to purchase a new tablet before it started a fire. Decided on the Samsung Tab S9 FE+ and have not regretted it. So much faster and a much bigger screen with a vivid display. Only drawback is it's a bit on the heavy side.","Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2024"

Erica Heath,"Love the tablet. Perfect for a digital artist. Screen is sensitive for the S pen, so perfect for drawing. Not many updates during shipping so hard to know where it was or when to be around to sign for it. Delivery lady was on time and friendly once the delivery time actually updated. Tablet DID NOT come with the ""book cover"" case that was listed in ""included compenents"" in the ad. They couldn't do anything about it unless I sent the whole thing back and couldn't just send me the book cover or a small credit to turn around and buy my own. Disappointed with that. Good tablet though.","Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2024"

Jake,"Performance: So far its been able to handle anything I do without many problems. Im able to use large 4000px + canvas sizes on multiple drawing apps w/o any lag or crashing. Simple editing on 4k videos also isn't a problem. But weirdly, the one thing it struggles on is screen mirroring. It'll disconnect or even out right crash sometimes, it happens often enough that I've stopped using it completely.
Battery: I only charge up to 85% and I still spend 10+ hours drawing with music on in the background without power saving on. The charging is also pretty fast.
Other: I wish the s pen was more comfortable, drawing or writing with it is painful for long periods - it needs a grip. The oem nib is ok, but a textured screen protector + metal nib feels necessary for drawing/writing.","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2024"

mbender,"I needed a new tablet since my other one had a UI System notification come up. The system was going out after 4 years. This tablet is fast and battery life on it lasts. I play games, music, videos, run cameras, and take credit card payments on it throughout each day. Like any other device, the more you use it, the more the battery drains. I'm usually on it full force for 6 to 7 hours before it let's me know my battery is at 15%. I'm at 50/59 at clearing my apps when I switch from one to the other, I keep a charger next to me all day, and I could get more out of the battery if I was more picky about it.

The pen works very well too. I've noticed I use the pen more on this tablet than any other tablet I've had prior. I got the 256gb on this one and surprisingly enough, I haven't had to delete stuff to make more room. If it had calling and texting on it permanently, I would be on the tablet more than my phone.

I mainly use it on the homes wifi so no need to spend an extra $27 for service on the tablet. If I need wifi connected on this tablet, I just connect it to my cell phone. All our phones have unlimited everything so it pays to use it.","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2023"
Tina Hall,"I'm sure the battery life would be better IF I didn't play games on it so much most of the day. Otherwise, it's a fabulous tablet! I just wish they gave me a charging cable instead of the type C to type C cable to switch apps, etc. What a waste of space in the box since I can do that over Wi-fi. I really did not need that cable. I NEED a charging cable! Why would they sell something without a way to charge it???? Extra??? Makes me think ""batteries not included""!!! Come on, Samsung. You can DO BETTER!!!

Constant Shopper,"It was hard to buy this, to me, expensive device.
I use my 2019 A tab all day long. (even though I have a very nice desktop computer and a fancy S22 ultra phone). I read, write, research, play stupid games, shop, watch videos, access my printer, do everything with it.
i\It can't stay connected to wifi 6, ane won't restart correctly. Some sites were not rendering correctly.
So, time for a new tablet.
It seemed like complete overkill to buy this tablet. Don't you think so? But it is a gift, that I was encouraged to accept.
We had a lot of AMEX reward dollars that made it easier to buy now that Amazon accepts them.
I was, again, encouraged to get this big size. It is pretty big. Is that necessary? I doubt it.
So far it runs well. It magically linked with my phone and now is a second phone. Along with my Samsung watch. See, I told you, too much stuff.
To me it charges very slowly. A full charge lasts a long time.
I am slow to get used to new things, but I think I like this device.
Maybe there was a tablet priced between the Tab A and this one. Ok this is the one between the tab A and the S9 tab, I get it.
I like that it is water resistant, but I never dunked the old Tab A.
I bet this new tablet will be $200 off in six weeks.

It had some features like full flagship tablet of Samsung tab s9, it had dex mode which can use like a laptop & come with s pen the speakers are loud enough watch videos and movies.
Tab s9 fe also had fingerprint Censor.
I Like how samsung give us options buy different colors of tab s9 fe unlike tab s9 only came with 2 color options.
Camera are good enough to take pictures and recording videos.
Samsung galaxy tab s9 fe is water & dust resistant so don't had worry about when it raining or getting dust on your tablet basically take with you everywhere.
There 5g options for this tablet now can.

Okay, so it looks like it does support wifi 6 as there is a little '6' next to the wifi symbol, but it does not support wifi 6E 6ghz band. I bought a USB wifi 6E adapter and that worked as it should and detected the 6ghz band.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023"

Full recomendada, aunque si tienen un poco mas de $$$ la FE+ o la S9 seria mejor.","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024"

Kristine Marsee,I really have been enjoying my new tablet. I wanted something with a pen so I can do more digital notes for various things like school and genealogy. So far it has been good. Be careful with the pin number! I didn't realize samsung erases everything if the pin code is forgotten. So now I'll probably have to factory reset and lose all my notes!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024"

Keith Henderson,"I wanted to get a tablet to use for sheet music and replace my binder of paper sheets.

It was very easy to start and set up.

So far, no issues. I which it came with a wall charger which I had to buy separately.","Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2024"
Dave,"Display is crisp and very clear, colors on screen are very vivid. Processors are very fast for all of the tasks I ask of it. One speaker on each end equals very nice sound. The OS upgraded to Android 14 One UI 6.0 immediately upon plugging it into my wireless network. The OS takes up 15.28GB of space. Even after loading all of my apps, I still have 97+GB of free space. It is heavier than my 4 year old Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2019), but I can still hold it with one hand for quite a while before fatigue sets in. I view this tablet as a very nice computer for the $$$ I spent on it. I believe I made a better choice than picking the Galaxy Tab A9+. Without a cover it can be a little slippery.","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2023"

Douglas Cahill,"Samsung S9fe is a good reasonably priced 10.9"" tablet. I got the 256gb and installed a 512gb micro sd card. So I have plenty of space. My only complaint is that there's no case available except directly from Samsung. Amazon has been ""out of stock"" for a while. I do like the Spen, it's a real benefit. (I have swollen fingers), it's also a large enough circumference to hold comfortably. All in all I'm pleased. The data transfer from my old A7 to this went smoothly. I used the provided cable to connect both together and almost everything transferred, that's simply a extremely minor annoyance. (2 games) All in all, I'm a happy camper.","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2023"
Amazon Customer,These work great. They're a little dark but it's OK that you have to try to read the business card inside because nobody needs to see it until they really need to see it.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2024"

Robbinse,"Well worth the $$$. Had purchased a Chromebook 2 360, and couldn't get it to connect or sync. Contacted Samsung directly, actually found out difference between tablet and laptop, and this tablet is AMAZING! Zero problems connecting and setting up. Very easy and quick. Also ordered the Samsung Keyboard Case Cover & Screen Protector. Can't say enough... very impressed, and it's expandable, and yes it syncs immediately with your phone and other products. Thank you!!!!!","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2024"
