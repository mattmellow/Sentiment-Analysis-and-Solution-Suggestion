<<<Obrigado pelo v√≠deo>>><<<I bought and returned S7 just recently. The reason is ridiculous - Samsung integrated a Samsung account into it, and if you can&#39;t sign in into your Samsung account you can&#39;t pass the initial setup process, which means you cannot use the tablet. My two-factor authentication phone number on Samsung account is the old one, and I couldn&#39;t pass the initial setup because of that. Spent several days, many hours with Samsung tech support, there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what, against their policy, which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what, ever. So, I couldn&#39;t complete the initial setup and had to return it.

That said, an SD slot is far more convenient, be it  a lot slower than an SSD drive.    At this point, we had SSD drives that are pretty darn small and can be attached right to the back of a device offering 1, 2 or even 4 TB&#39;s of storage dirt cheap.  The world of tablets continues to get better.   Start with apps you want.  Android is useless if your favorite app isn&#39;t supported!
