<<< Thanks for the video >>><<< I bought and returned S7 just recently The reason is ridiculous Samsung integrated a Samsung account into it and if you cant sign in into your Samsung account you cant pass the initial setup process which means you cannot use the tablet My twofactor authentication phone number on Samsung account is the old one and I couldnt pass the initial setup because of that Spent several days many hours with Samsung tech support there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what against their policy which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what ever So I couldnt complete the initial setup and had to return it Stupidity is on the next level >>><<< going Android is too much sacrifice lol >>><<< Have you heard of the

how curious here in brazil a s9 ultra is way cheaper than an ipad pro I wonder why >>><<< I want that tablet >>><<< The tablet acrobat of juggernauts in the flat in you hand world is the s tab series razor thin and sharp strong connection is a phenomenal tablet when I say phenomenal I mean exquisite I Boasted over these tablets last year so I know this tablet is better but I might not get to experience it because there might be a Ten before I can get my hands on one so yes I agree that tablet does damage to the iPad but wait for ios and soc capability is pretty impressive due to the fact it will lock you out of the dawm device for a month and once you get it unlocked its like it was never locked I really cant say the same thing for Samsung s tab Because we know once its gone thats it so who cares its multitasking and customizability knocks that apple out of the tree also the UNIX lossy storage is very useful in certain use cases then you have expandable storage of s tab you just cant beat it thats it >>><<< thank you >>><<< Whats up everyone I hope this complete Tab S9 lineup buying Guide was helpful Did I cover what you wanted to know What else did you want to see or learn

plug into a hub or even direct to external SSD has pretty much unlimited storage for files That said an SD slot is far more convenient be it a lot slower than an SSD drive At this point we had SSD drives that are pretty darn small and can be attached right to the back of a device offering 1 2 or even 4 TBs of storage dirt cheap The world of tablets continues to get better Start with apps you

>>><<< I got the 109 Tab S9 FE just yesterdayand given my planned usage for it secondary tablet for ebooks reading and media consumption I think the battery is gonna do incredibly good for me >>><<< Better than ipad >>><<< I just got this Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 11 inch model I ordered an IPAD 5th generation from Amazon to see which I would like The Tab A9 11inch model appears to be a clear winner I previously had an 8inch Galaxy Tab7 lite which was about 8 inches This new Tabsa9 plus is 11 inches so about 15 inches longer and wider For ereaders I use LIBBY it is a bit big but slender and can still fit on the top of treadmill ledges and is a decent size for airplane travel The new tablet is super light so hardly any weight difference Screen is super bright and the computing power is fast Im a macapple user but found that it seems to be seamlessly and quickly connecting to my iphone 15 I ordered an electronic pen for writing notes and the size of this seems perfect for it I also ordered a glass screen protector and a case both were cheap This tab device is fantastic in that you can easily buy and load additional storage space It is a Ferrari of an ereader but with the electronic pen writing capacity plus colorful screen and fast computing power it works great as a notebook style computer Really for the money it retails for dollar219 it is a fantastic buy The ipads from Apple were all 35 times the price To get an ipad for this price I needed to go to an old whoknows how long it will work 2017 model ipad No question this is a wonderful product by Samsung and Im speaking as a fan of Apple I totally recommend this tablet at this time at least Once I start really using it If I have any dissatisfactions Ill post an edited review >>><<< Excellent value and the screen is vivid and responsive like all Samsung products I opted to NOT get the version for a phone service as I can always link my smartphone to this screen if needed It readily connects to wifi and I suggest using a VPN for security as well as using the Brave browser and turning off typical Google data harvesting features like location It does not come with a USBC power source just a cable If you dont have one a charger with this output consider buying one when you purchase the tablet I also found it charges well from another USBC charger I normally use for my smartphone You will probably also want to get a screen protector there are MANY brands and types available to select from at costs ranging from dollar5 to about dollar80 I chose one that protects the screen and serves as a stand but is flat and allows me to carry the tablet in my vest without worrying about scratching the screen >>><<< i orginaly got this for my digital keyboard and media consumption but then i started using it for school and to help me study imo it was very worth its price i ended up buying another for a family member since it was so useful and affordable i dont use it to write notes but i did play around with writing on it and it didnt seem bad at all i just enjoy paper notes more the battery life is great and the screen is nice obviously its not an ultra 4k hd screen but it is very nice and i never feel like i need more in my time using it i have not felt like i needed more in any aspect i havent used the dex mode since i dont need it but i can imagine it working very nicely since i always have multiple apps open when doing school work it has helped me so much from what i originally got it for and very much exceeded my expectations if your looking for a very nice inexpensive tablet theres no reason not to get this one i have the 8g ram and its never felt slow i bought a 4gb for a family member and they have never noticed any issues with it >>><<< Ive had this tablet for about a day and put it through its paces with all the streaming apps that I use except one that wont work with the tablet because it hasnt been updated by the service and it worked wonderfully for all of them The FullHD capable screen is bright and punchy while the speakers are crisp and clear with or without the Dolby Atmos sound enhancement turned on As far as gaming goes its not a gaming tablet by any means but it will play most older Android titles fairly well particularly the puzzle games or JRPG ports from various companies like Kemco and SquareEnix The one and only area in which this tablet falls short in all metrics is the WiFi as Samsung chose to use a cheap WiFi chip that only has a single connection that means no MIMO WiFi and it tops out at 433Mbps which means its WiFi is subpar and does not pair well with the speedy CPU and RAM that would give superfast download speeds and a stronger WiFi connection with a 2x2 WiFi design Apart from that the tablet is almost perfect though some may find Samsungs latest One UI to be clunky and awkward to use as it has some quirky design flaws that detract from usability in comparison to regular Android tablets that use Googles own interface >>><<< This thing is great Large screen and long battery life Using it for work so not really stressing it out at all but it runs smoothly The camera sticks out a good amount so if you plan to not use a case be aware of that And it takes a long time to charge up even on a super fast charger no super charge option only fast and normal but still over night its good to go Expandable storage is really nice and it seamlessly captured the data from my current samsung device >>><<< I purchased this tablet primary for reading as I needed something that could run the Cloud Library app for digital library books So far it has served me well with no issues The Samsung A9 replaces my Kindle Fire and it is faster and far superior I have streamed video and played a few games on it as well and it does its jobs If youre not looking for anything with lots of bells and whistles this is a good middle of the road tablet >>><<< This was an upgrade from my iPad Personally I like android devices I dont need anything too in depth This is perfect for my use Emails Texts Web A few game apps and uTube I also like pairing it to my Galaxy phone to make and receive calls Good value and good item Satisfied with this purchase >>><<< This is my 4th Samsung galaxy tablet Each has been an upgrade Where do I start The larger screen is nice The graphics are awesome The sound with the Dolby Atmos system is really great The smooth screen refresh rate is amazing The colors are rich The better wifi connections are so nice I really enjoy using my new tablet Getting it on sale was a bonus For the price it cant be beat Transferring everything from my old tablet was seamless I cant say enough about this tablet Highly recommended >>><<< My old samsung tablet died after many years of use I knew I wanted another samsung so I tried several different ones before going with this one I liked the large screen of the 124 A9 FE but with a case it was heavier than I was looking for and felt too large for travelling I looked at a different samsung 11 but the graphics were not as good as the 124 But this one does have the nice graphics and with a case it doesnt feel too heavy and is compact enough for travel More than I wanted to spend on a tablet but given my previous Samsung tablet lasted about 10 years I decided it was worth it and so far it has been >>><<< I mostly bought this tablet just to stream shows and read on Both of which it does perfectly The tablet is quick and snappy with loading and navigating which is probably due it its Qualcomm processor Ive found myself frustrated many times trying to use slow and sluggish budget devices so Im very satisfied with the experience here The 1080p picture on the lcd display isnt anything amazing but for a budget device it gets by I love the smooth 90hz capability as well However I dont love that out of box my unit suffers from a dead pixel on the lcd but fortunately its so small that its barely noticeable Its not a deal breaker for me I just expect better quality control from Samsung Surprisingly a major positive is the sound quality I found myself ditching the earbuds a lot with this tablet The sound is loud and clear with its four speakers Very surprising for a budget device Overall Id recommend this tablet to anyone wants an affordable and capable device either for work or leasure I havent tried gaming on it but Im sure it would handle itself pretty well A great value but If this tablet goes on sale than its pretty much a no brainer Note Annoyingly this tablet doesnt a include a USBC charging brick I had to use my phone charger instead because the included charging cable was USBC to USBC I only own USBA bricks So be prepared >>><<< I love the tablet however the one I ordered from Amazon I had to return It was advertised as being the 5g model When I took it to my internet provider it did not have the correct chip holder for wifi operation I ended up getting the same tablet but with the correct chip card holder from my provider and returning the one to Amazon I wanted the new Samsung tablet especially for its 5g capabilities I figured out later that was probably why the Amazon one was a lot less in price Still a wonderful tablet And Amazon readily took back the original one >>><<< Im giving it a 4 out 5 stars because Im a be honest with you I HOPE THE WAY I WRITE THIS DOESNT MESS UP Pros Big Screen 90Hz Refresh Rate Not Adaptive Btw 1080p Quality 1920x1080 not changeable just FHD Big Battery Life Can Game but remember 64GB Storage 4GB RAM but 128GB Storage 8GB RAM Micro SD Card Up to 1TB I think u can put SIM Card too Maybe Has Samsung Dex To Turn it into a mini PC Has the 3 dots on the edge for keyboard and mouse Cheaper than the S Models of Samsung Tablets Cons TFT Panel Looks LCD to me but it doesnt have OLED Colors are not as good as OLED devices which is too be expected Charging Takes Long but last awhile just not sure what is the maximum fast charging it can take Maybe 20 watts Doesnt have SPen No 120Hz Refrest Rate Not ADAPTIVE 1120Hz No QHD 2560x1440p Viewing Angles are alright but you can notice the LCDTFT display always the blacks are not looking black instead its dark grayish Camera is okay still blurry >>><<< I upgraded from a Galaxy A8 and loving this tablet except for the current software bug effecting these A9 models There is an issue with the multipoint touch such as when pinch zooming or playing a game that involves 2 fingers touching at the same time It is very glitchy You kinda have to finesse the pinch zoom with a light touch and it will work If you dont play games and arent constantly using the pinch zoom function which most probably arent you will hardly notice the issue Though if you play games involving multitouch this will be a problem for you Strangely though if you plug corded headphones into the jack the problem stops really weird It does seem to just be a software bug though and Samsung should be able to fix the problem with an update patch Unfortunately little problems like this are just part of the technological world we live in now and occasionally happens to the devices we use and they need to be updated Other than that though This tablet feels nice and light runs fast and smooth with the upgraded processor and increased 8GB of RAM on the A9 model and the screen has a beautiful bright picture with nice deep and vibrant colors I did a side by side HD video comparison with my A8 and the picture on the A9 is quite a noticeable improvement And I see people saying that theres didnt come with a charger as if its a mistake It is not a mistake Samsung doesnt send chargers with their products anymore They say its to minimize their impact on the environment or whatever and also because I think they know most people have plenty of charging blocks and USB C cables laying around at this point being that so many products use them now and if you dont you can buy one very cheap With all that said if you can deal with the current multitouch problem until its fixed I high >>><<< My 2017 8 A8 is getting long in the tooth Ive had some software incompatibility show up Android 9 doesnt cut it anymore The battery is also starting to lose charge a bit The A9 has Android 14 and a new battery so those issues are gone Everything seems to work according to Samsungs usual high standards People in reviews seem to complain about slow charging Its 2024 folks My fast chargers have no problem charging it up in a few hours My one complaint is the size 11 inches is great for sitting on a desktop and viewing things but I have a television and a laptop for that I miss the old A8s 8 screen that allowed for comfortable handholding Alas even the new A8 is 10 inches I looked at other brands but Samsung was still the best bet >>><<< Bought for chef at restaurant I work at He photographs the dishes with the camera feature and the picture quality is awesome Whenever hes off the other chefs can use the tablet to reference the dish in question He also photographs new dishes and sends them to the owners to inquire on a possible new special >>><<< This tablet has been doing very well for me There is a transfer program built in that helps you step by step move your data from your old Samsung Galaxy Tab to this new one The processor is very good there is a plentiful amount of RAM and there still are ports you can plug into I got the HXCASEAC Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 A9 Plus Case 11 Inch and it is also the second time Ive bought this case Protective rubber and a built in screen protector Shamefully I was upgrading from a Tab 7 and probably wouldnt have done that if the batteries hadnt swollen and gotten hot But back to this tablet If youve had a Tab before worry not here things just got better The colors the feels its all there I purchased a 1TB MicroSD card and it has a home in this Tab 9 Beyond that Im not sure what I can say about this Tab oh yeah its from Samsung so its full of Samsung goodness >>><<< At first I was hesitant because being a tablet I always doubt if it will be good or not or if it will be fast But I must confess that this tablet has surprised me I bought it for my 5 year old son for his school work It is very fast lightweight with a friendly and updated operating system It met my expectations 100percent >>><<< I use my tablet constantly for playing games having virtual Doctors appointments online shopping and online banking It is very fast fastest Ive ever had actually and it is so easy to use I absolutely love how thin it is and lightweight Because a lot of them are super heavy for what they are I love that this has a 128 GB of storage Cause I can have any app that I have Heart set on and I dont have to worry about anything going over Or having backup storage You can also use a microSD card with it I have not needed to but I do own one if that is ever needed Overall This is the best tablet Ive ever owned and Ive owned a lot of different tablets over the years I love this more than my previous iPad And my previous Kindle HD 10 highly recommended 10 out of 10 >>><<< Ok so I originally tried the Amazon Fire because it claimed to be so awesome Im still waiting for the refund But this Samsung so far has been a jewel for me So far so good Very happy to have found this one for 10dollar less than the Fire that has no special features >>><<< I was looking around for a Samsung tablet and found a variety of them priced all over the place I ordered one for dollar79 and it ran out of memory very quickly I was constantly deleting photos and music in order to have enough memory for my apps I realized I needed something with a lot more memory I looked at some of the Samsung Tablets that cost as much as dollar800 before settling on the Samsung Tab A9 Its probably not as good as the top of the line Samsung Tablets but on the other hand it was only dollar199 and for that price its a bargain >>><<< We have has the A9 a couple days now We have each has Samsung tablets for several years We have liked them This one has features to love We have however spent more time with it on the charger than in our hands >>><<< Maybe my old tablet was just too old to not appreciate the evolution and trends of tablets in general but the screen on this tablet is so much nicer than what I had previously Definitely it has a speedperformance advantage as well >>><<< Best work tablet Ive had the only reason for taking off 1 star is the battery takes 2 or more hours to charge up from 30percent and it drains down to that in about 3 hours of use Thats with a brand name rapid charger and a high quality cable As others have mentioned the USB receptacle takes extra care to plug in firmly A small hassle but worth it to me for the overall performance >>><<< As far as Im concerned everything should be made by Samsung it is a great company the color is vivid ease operation touch works great put a cover on it in a safe screen high performance product great job >>><<< I bought this to use as an inexpensive tablet I could use while backpacking I was looking for something really basic that I could read at camp check maps and listen to music offline while hiking Being a Samsung it meant I would be able to find a decent case for it to provide at least some basic protection If it got damaged during the hike well it was a cheap tablet so it should be good enough It had 55percent battery when it arrived so I plugged it into a USBC cable I had plugged into the USB port on my wall outlet I figured this would be alright since it would need to be charged from a portable power source in the field anyway After 48 minutes it managed to charge only to 64percent I wanted to err on it being my cable so I plugged it into a USBC power brick instead and put that in my outlet My wall outlets are 20w and this requires 15w to charge so it should totally work It managed to hit 100percent 45 hours later Taking four and a half hours to charge anything 36percent is insane When I finally was able to power the tablet on the screen was so dim I could barely see anything After rushing through the typical Android setup I managed to increase the display brightness to around 50percent After installing 3 apps I noticed that the battery was at 93percent for less than a half hour of use I definitely do not recommend this tablet The cons far outweigh the pros in this device especially since finding a budget tablet is not really that hard to find these days >>><<< I bought this as a second tablet besides my S6 Lite I love it because of the bigger storage and the picture and sound quality are amazing The screen is several inches bigger than my S6 Lite but its not too big The only thing I didnt like was that it didnt come with the S Pen which I know it didnt but bought some capacitive stylus and problem solved Overall I am very happy with this tablet I will always stick to Samsung for phones air buds and tablets as they are hard to beat >>><<< This is supposed to be the lower end affordable tabletI honestly like it better than the more expensive flagship tablet I got my wife The speakers are phenomenal the picture is top shelf I highly recommend Also awesome it included headphone jack and SD card expansion up to 1TB >>><<< The lighter weight makes this tablet easier to use than my last Galaxy I really trust Samsung products they always have superior quality and ease of use Will buy again in future if need be >>><<< I got my tablet on Saturday I am very happy with 8t It was easy to set up Its fast Everything I needed is in this tablet So far I love my new tablet I recommend ordering this tablet for yourself >>><<< Ive always had the best Galaxy tablets the S series Thought Id try A series Verdict not quite as quick or sharp as S but overall satisfactory What youll notice most a little hesitation and jerkiness when you pinch or expand screen size with your fingers Works better when you resize a little slower and smoother Update on 3324 That hesitation and jerkiness when you use fingers to pinchexpand screen is worse than I thought its intolerable Im going to live with it for now but contrary to what I wrote I would not buy A9 again For dollar200 more I could have had the crispness speed and smooth functionality of the S9 >>><<< I purchased the Samsung Galaxy A9 8128 model and inputted a 128 GB Samsung SD card and am able to offset app space and downloads right to the card to conserve space I have had the tablet for a week and have no speed or input issues and visually the tablet itself is sleek I am using for work and have had no productivity issues sharing service and apps between my ZFold 3 I recommend purchase I shopped around for two months and am happy with my choice Will provide update in 6 months but anticipate no issues Battery lasts roughly 32 hours on full charge with mid to full use each day I am happy with that Fast charging is complete in 15 hours from 5percent Regardless research anyway and make the best choice for you >>><<< Very nice Samsung tablet lots of storage Big battery but can not be fast charged Last night I was at 27percent battery I plugged it in and this morning it was only on 83percent 7 hours S pen does not work on this tablet You can draw in Samsung notes but you cant write with a stylist Its a little too big for holding it But its great on a table or desk Over all a great tablet at a great price >>><<< Purchased another tablet but found it difficult for a tech challenged person to use This tablet was easy to set up and easy to use >>><<< I havent personally owned a tablet that I loved since the Nexus 7 which still bring back fond memories You cannot go wrong with this tablet buti have to be honest Im a samsung guy Another great product that I use for college and for my personal Bible study >>><<< The A9 is a good general use product It doesnt have a high res screen with OLED or 120Hz but it gets the job done I really appreciated the headphone jack and MicroSD card slot However I wish it had a fingerprint reader and frontfacing speakers The screen is sharp at this size but it dims noticeably off angle Luckily the battery charges quickly Also a case can be gotten on Amazon for under dollar500 >>><<< No issues so far i use this for bills and app i dont want on my phone everything i needed was available for download so thats a plus for me >>><<< The tablet fits my needs to a T Now you can 100percent notice its a 1080p resolution and 60hz refresh rate Its definitely a budget tablet but plays games no problem screen is nice and bright and the speakers sound pretty good If you dont mind the lower resolution and refresh rate then this is the best option for you >>><<< This tablet could be made by anyone There appears to be no external branding However it is all Samsung in its operation >>><<< I was promised a case with this product to no avail I called Amazon and they took 10percent off my purchased however now the tablet is selling for a great deal lower than what I paid for it terrible advertising the sound is very good with this tablet however the charging takes a very long time the battery life is mediocre I would return the product to get to get the product dollar50 cheaper but I dont want to go through all the trouble beware it does not come with a case thats the reason why I purchased it that and the sound quality >>><<< Extremely satisfied with my purchase bought this one to upgrade from Amazon fire 10 and glad I made the choice I like it better than any other tablet Ive had screen is a great size for less strain on the eyes >>><<< So far happy with the purchase installing and updating the applications Everything arrived perfectly by DHL >>><<< I love the tablet only complaint you need to send a compatible plug >>><<< Good quality and uses the same OS as my phones Transferring files was a BREEZE I would do business with this seller again >>><<< I use this every day its fast and glad I got it >>><<< I bought 2 tab from this seller the first one was brand new and saw how good it was I order a 2nd one for my niece the second one i got it was not brand new it had the sticker when you give a second chance an item I know and i remember well I order a new one not a used one I dont mind this but please state what one is ordering because i paid for a brand new item and it came in a bag >>><<< I did not receive the cover that came with the tablet according to the photo I received a cover that came with the glass but it did not arrive with the tablet >>><<< I love this tablet connected perfectly with my android Doesnt lag and so manyyyy features Get it >>><<< Tablet really nice but its static alot Takes a long time to startup and sometimes screen cannot be cleared I really miss my Samsung T820 Tablet its broken thats why i got this A9 but its lagging I should be returning shortlyexchanging >>><<< I had to replace my tablet ASAP and this was the upgrade This was dollar100 less than what I was going to pay at my retailer Exact same tablet It works great is a great size Great purchase Im so happy with this tablet >>><<< THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS VERY GOOD IT MEETS MY NEEDS AT THE MOMENT THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT THE SUPPLIER OFFERS THE BOOK COVER FOR FREE WITH THE PURCHASE FOR THE GRAPHITE COLOR AND IN THE END IT DOESNT BRING IT I STILL KEPT THE TABLET AND BUY A SEPARATE COVER >>><<< This tablet is nice Im very happy with it Does everything with no lagging and very nice >>><<< After a long long time my old Samsung 7 tablet finally conked out It was too slow and didnt have enough storage anyway I knew I was going to buy another Samsung but wanted a good deal I splurged and bought the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9 11 Tablet w 128GB of storage My God this is super FAST If you are watching a video its like having a small TV in your lap table or hand The speed and storage is incredible Plus lots and lots of new features since my old one Suggestion buy a screen protector and a cover to keep it like new >>><<< A little heavier than expected but not by much Other than that the best you can get at this range price >>><<< Its a Samsung A9 5G whats not to like no more wifi if I dont want connect to it in public locations Loaded software is more than adequate to do most all of your basic work or play music and videos needs will buy again >>><<< I returned due to I needed wireless service not just wifi >>><<< I mostly use it for Facebook in my library app to read books It works great and I love it >>><<< The tablet is very good it is large and for the price it is worth it for social networks and music and entertainment OK The sorrow >>><<< Very happy with tablet and case >>><<< I have been using this tablet for a few weeks and love it No glitches or delays Would purchase again >>><<< Received my tablet in 1day really not even 24hrs Opened the box connected with a QR on my phone and my setup was complete in less than 10 minutes So far our bonding is going well >>><<< Great tablet BUT it doesnt come with a charger that I was unaware of so if you going to buy this device make sure you buy a type C charger with it because it doesnt come with one It comes with the charger cord but not the charger adapter that you plug into the outlet >>><<< I like the big sceen and it being the A series for the budget price >>><<< Inexpensive easy to navigate works as intended >>><<< Like everything about this unit Sound system is incredibly perfect with 4 speakerscase for this tablet with its 11 screen is a tad difficult to find but is attainable here on Amazonjust pay CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SCREEN SIZEEZY TO M AKE MISTAKEFASTSAFEDELIVERYALL GOOD RAS24 >>><<< I bought so that I could use Smart View to Cast Dribbleup on to my Roku TV I tried lower versions but they either didnt have a high enough Android OS original not updated 12 which messes up the dribbleup sound or they didnt have SmartView software to wirelessly cast I boughtreturned about 3 samsungs before I found a good one and I didnt want a phone version just because it would have been too small without the TV So this worked The only thing is that I have to search for smartview when Im in settings I cant just scroll down to it like Id like to >>><<< The tablet is an excellent product and is easy to setup and use >>><<< Wouldnt recommend it for gaming otherwise it works quite nicely as a media device >>><<< This was a birthday present for my husband Its just what he wanted >>><<< I replaced my Lenovo with this I should have gotten Samsung in the 1st place >>><<< Works great and priced at a awesome price >>><<< Its perfect for what I wanted >>><<< This thing does everything I need and I love it Its very fast and has an memory to hold all the games I want to play >>><<< Memory good Battery has good life faster than Galaxy A tablet all streaming apps work well >>><<< I purchased a different tablet 2 years ago it was so slow I reset it to factory settings it was just useless LOL I did my research and all the fingers pointed by this And boy am I glad I did It was delivered to my house in like 2 days fantastic price and it has a speed as fast as a bullet I am so loving this tablet It absolutely does everything If I had an extra thumb Id give it three thumbs up LOL >>><<< Tab fits small organization or personal use perfectly >>><<< The tablet does the job The only draw back is the Super slow recharge speed And if youre looking for a good S pen at low price The CCIVV Stylus Pen 2 in 1 Fine Point Mesh Tip Stylus for Touch Screen Compatible for Tablet and Cellphone works great with the tablet >>><<< Have no complaints Great tablet >>><<< Nice >>><<< I really like this tablet Its fast the screen is big and clear Also since I have a Samsung phone it quickly moved all of my apps over to the tablet The sound also is really good I purchased it to mainly watch movies and stream shows from my apps So the clarity is good the sound is good Surfing the internet with WiFi has been quick also Quality and price cannot be beat >>><<< Bought this to work with my Cricut Joy able to link up >>><<< No complaints whatsoever Good size fits the hands well clear and sharp screen fast And the battery lasts forever I use it lightly for the record but it has been on for over 2 weeks and is still around 20percent battery >>><<< Versatile for kids homeworks >>><<< Fairly easy to copy everything from existing old Samsung tablet >>><<< I had a Fire tablet which was great but my cat decided to launch it off my dresser and the screen broke So this is my replacement I have a Samsung phone so this was a no brainer for me It does everything I need and allows me to be work productive >>><<< I ordered this tablet for my husband because his old one was getting really slow and he wanted to upgrade The new one was just what he wanted and its big enough for him to see with ease It was reasonably priced too >>><<< My husband has the earlier version of this tablet I would walk by and see him enjoying using it That said I really wanted it for music and solitaire and reading the news with these older eyes and just surfing for stuff Got it loaded it up took a whileand after 2 days of use asked myself what took you so long to get one Its wonderful The sound quality is amazing and the screen qualityperfect Went back for a really pretty girlie case to have it sit on my lap Who needs a apple Not me Thank you >>><<< Very happy with it >>><<< Ive only had the tablet for a little over a week but love it so far I wanted something smaller than the laptop for traveling and its perfect I was able to get all my apps loaded My kindle app has all my books I can manage my bills on this I can listen to music or even watch a movie Its lightweight after charging it the first time I didnt have to charge it again for 9 days So far its great >>><<< Ease setup perfect size Travel readyget the case and charger with it >>><<< Delivery on time good seller >>><<< This tablet is really big and runs smooth I have zero complaints the camera isnt the best of the best but who buys a tablet for the camera The performance battery life screen resolution are top notch You wont be disappointed I want to mention though that this is a WiFi only version of the tab A9 Plus so you cant use a physical SIM card nor an e Sim >>><<< Good size price and performance Wish the little setup leaflet had more explicit instructions If I were not a longterm Samsung and android user Im not sure setup would have gone well Overall I am satisfied and would recommend I have zero interest in games so cant speak to that aspect >>><<< I have had the A9 now for 10 days so I have got a good feel for it and as far as tablets under dollar250 this will be tough to beat I love the big screen that comes with it Its great for Netflix and YouTube or anything else like that You dont get 4K with this tablet but 1080 is more than good enough You get great audio and the battery life is exceptional On a full charge you get 2 days of use and thats with me heavily using it I recommend getting the 128 gb version of this tablet given its a tremendous value If you are use to using a laptop or a PC this tablet comes equipped with Samsung Dex which gives you that same look and feel so thats a big plus Overall its a really good tablet for the price that comes with a lot of bells and whistles you see with a expensive tablet I highly recommend >>><<< Excellent Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 with 64 GB quad speakersNetflix is now soundtasticthis upgrade was under dollar200 Awesome features and speed Also the easiest setup using the android Smart Switch that transferred data from my Samsung Tab A version 2017 to the Samsung Tab A9 version 2023woohoo Go Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 for an under

it >>><<< Its okay if youre just using it to tinker around on Battery isnt all that great I was on it for an hour and a half starting from 100percent and it is now 78percent My phone last longer than that I like Samsung thats what my phone is I just think they could have done better with this I think the price is a little to high for a 2023 and no more than what it is >>><<< ly recommend getting this tablet as everything else about it is great >>>
