Paul,"I just got this Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 11 inch model. I ordered an IPAD 5th generation from Amazon to see which I would like. The Tab A9+ 11-inch model appears to be a clear winner. I previously had an 8-inch Galaxy Tab7 lite which was about 8 inches. This new Tabsa9 plus is 11 inches, so about 1.5 inches longer and wider. For ereaders (I use LIBBY) it is a bit big, but slender and can still fit on the top of treadmill ledges and is a decent size for airplane travel. The new tablet is super light so hardly any weight difference. Screen is super bright and the computing power is fast. I’m a mac/apple user, but found that it seems to be seamlessly and quickly connecting to my iphone 15. I ordered an electronic pen for writing notes, and the size of this seems perfect for it. I also ordered a glass screen protector and a case, both were cheap. This tab device is fantastic in that you can easily buy and load additional storage space. It is a Ferrari of an ereader, but with the electronic pen writing capacity plus colorful screen, and fast computing power, it works great as a notebook style computer. Really, for the money (it retails for $219) it is a fantastic buy. The ipads from Apple were all 3-5 times the price. To get an ipad for this price I needed to go to an old, who-knows how long it will work, 2017 model ipad. No question, this is a wonderful product by Samsung, and I’m speaking as a fan of Apple. I totally recommend this tablet at this time at least. Once I start really using it If I have any dissatisfactions I’ll post an edited review.","Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2024"
Walter W. Watson,"Excellent value and the screen is vivid and responsive (like all Samsung products). I opted to NOT get the version for a phone service as I can always link my smartphone to this screen if needed. It readily connects to wifi and I suggest using a VPN for security (as well as using the Brave browser and turning off typical Google data harvesting features like location).

It does not come with a USB-C power source, just a cable. If you don't have one a charger with this output , consider buying one when you purchase the tablet. I also found it charges well from another USB-C charger I normally use for my smartphone.

You will probably also want to get a screen protector - there are MANY brands and types available to select from at costs ranging from $5 to about $80. I chose one that protects the screen and serves as a stand, but is flat and allows me to carry the tablet in my vest without worrying about scratching the screen.","Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2024"
Daniel,"i orginaly got this for my digital keyboard and media consumption. but then i started using it for school and to help me study. imo it was very worth its price. i ended up buying another for a family member since it was so useful and affordable. i dont use it to write notes but i did play around with writing on it and it didnt seem bad at all i just enjoy paper notes more. the battery life is great and the screen is nice. obviously its not an ultra 4k hd +++ screen but it is very nice and i never feel like i need more. in my time using it i have not felt like i needed more in any aspect. i havent used the dex mode since i dont need it but i can imagine it working very nicely since i always have multiple apps open when doing school work. it has helped me so much from what i originally got it for and very much exceeded my expectations.

if your looking for a very nice inexpensive tablet theres no reason not to get this one. i have the 8g ram and its never felt slow. i bought a 4gb for a family member and they have never noticed any issues with it.","Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2024"
A. Nemo,"I've had this tablet for about a day and put it through it's paces with all the streaming apps that I use - except one that won't work with the tablet because it hasn't been updated by the service - and it worked wonderfully for all of them. The Full-HD capable screen is bright and punchy, while the speakers are crisp and clear with or without the Dolby Atmos sound enhancement turned on. As far as gaming goes, it's not a gaming tablet by any means, but it will play most older Android titles fairly well, particularly the puzzle games or JRPG ports from various companies like Kemco and Square-Enix. The one and only area in which this tablet falls short in all metrics is the WiFi, as Samsung chose to use a cheap WiFi chip that only has a single connection - that means no MIMO WiFi - and it tops out at 433Mbps, which means it's WiFi is sub-par and does not pair well with the speedy CPU and RAM that would give super-fast download speeds and a stronger WiFi connection with a 2x2 WiFi design. Apart from that, the tablet is almost perfect, though some may find Samsung's latest One UI to be clunky and awkward to use, as it has some quirky design flaws that detract from usability in comparison to regular Android tablets that use Google's own interface.","Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024"
Peter S.,This thing is great! Large screen and long battery life. Using it for work so not really stressing it out at all but it runs smoothly. The camera sticks out a good amount so if you plan to not use a case be aware of that. And it takes a long time to charge up even on a super fast charger (no super charge option only fast and normal) but still over night its good to go. Expandable storage is really nice and it seamlessly captured the data from my current samsung device.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2024"
Kindle Customer,"I purchased this tablet primary for reading as I needed something that could run the Cloud Library app for digital library books. So far, it has served me well with no issues. The Samsung A9 replaces my Kindle Fire and it is faster and far superior. I have streamed video and played a few games on it as well and it does it's jobs. If you're not looking for anything with lots of bells and whistles, this is a good, middle of the road tablet.","Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2024"
RetVet,This was an upgrade from my iPad. Personally I like android devices. I don't need anything too in depth. This is perfect for my use. Emails. Texts. Web. A few game apps and uTube. I also like pairing it to my Galaxy phone to make and receive calls. Good value and good item. Satisfied with this purchase.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2024"
Terry G,"This is my 4th Samsung galaxy tablet. Each has been an upgrade. Where do I start? The larger screen is nice. The graphics are awesome. The sound with the Dolby Atmos system is really great. The smooth screen refresh rate is amazing. The colors are rich. The better wifi connections are so nice. I really enjoy using my new tablet. Getting it on sale was a bonus. For the price, it can't be beat. Transferring everything from my old tablet was seamless. I can't say enough about this tablet. Highly recommended!!!","Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024"
Brooster,"My old samsung tablet died after many years of use. I knew I wanted another samsung so I tried several different ones before going with this one.

I liked the large screen of the 12.4"" A9 FE, but with a case, it was heavier than I was looking for and felt too large for travelling. I looked at a different samsung 11"", but the graphics were not as good as the 12.4"". But this one does have the nice graphics and with a case, it doesn't feel too heavy and is compact enough for travel. More than I wanted to spend on a tablet, but given my previous Samsung tablet lasted about 10 years, I decided it was worth it and so far, it has been.","Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2024"
Joseph G.,"I mostly bought this tablet just to stream shows and read on. Both of which it does perfectly. The tablet is quick and snappy with loading and navigating which is probably due it it's Qualcomm processor, I've found myself frustrated many times trying to use slow and sluggish budget devices so I'm very satisfied with the experience here. The 1080p picture on the lcd display isn't anything amazing but for a budget device it gets by, I love the smooth 90hz capability as well.

However I don't love that out of box my unit suffers from a dead pixel on the lcd but fortunately it's so small that it's barely noticeable. It's not a deal breaker for me I just expect better quality control from Samsung.

Surprisingly a major positive is the sound quality. I found myself ditching the earbuds a lot with this tablet. The sound is loud and clear with it's four speakers! Very surprising for a budget device.

Overall I'd recommend this tablet to anyone wants an affordable and capable device either for work or leasure. I haven’t tried gaming on it but I'm sure it would handle itself pretty well. A great value but If this tablet goes on sale than it's pretty much a no brainer.

Note: Annoyingly this tablet doesn't a include a USB-C charging brick. I had to use my phone charger instead because the included charging cable was USB-C to USB-C. I only own USB-A bricks. So be prepared.","Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2024"
gail e. friebus,"I love the tablet, however, the one I ordered from Amazon I had to return. It was advertised as being the 5g model. When I took it to my internet provider, it did not have the correct chip holder for wifi operation! I ended up getting the same tablet, but with the correct chip card holder, from my provider and returning the one to Amazon. I wanted the new Samsung tablet especially for its 5g capabilities. I figured out later, that was probably why the Amazon one was a lot less in price. Still a wonderful tablet! And, Amazon readily took back the original one.","Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2024"
Samiul Sami,"I'm giving it a 4 out 5 stars because I'm a be honest with you. I HOPE THE WAY I WRITE THIS DOESNT MESS UP!
Pros:
● Big Screen
● 90Hz Refresh Rate (Not Adaptive Btw)
● 1080p Quality (1920x1080 not changeable just FHD)
● Big Battery Life
● Can Game but remember 64GB Storage = 4GB RAM but 128GB Storage = 8GB RAM
● Micro SD Card (Up to 1TB)
● I think u can put SIM Card too (Maybe)
● Has Samsung Dex (To Turn it into a mini PC)
● Has the 3 dots on the edge for keyboard and mouse
● Cheaper than the S Models of Samsung Tablets
Cons:
● TFT Panel (Looks LCD to me, but it doesn't have OLED)
● Colors are not as good as OLED devices which is too be expected.
● Charging Takes Long but last awhile, just not sure what is the maximum fast charging it can take. (Maybe 20 watts).
● Doesn't have S-Pen
● No 120Hz Refrest Rate (Not ADAPTIVE 1-120Hz)
● No QHD+ (2560x1440p)
● Viewing Angles are alright but you can notice the LCD/TFT display always the blacks are not looking black instead it's dark grayish.
● Camera is okay, still blurry.","Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2024"
It'sMe412,"I upgraded from a Galaxy A8 and loving this tablet, except for the current software bug effecting these A9 models. There is an issue with the multi-point touch such as when pinch zooming or playing a game that involves 2 fingers touching at the same time. It is very glitchy. You kinda have to finesse the pinch zoom with a light touch and it will work. If you don't play games and aren't constantly using the pinch zoom function which most probably aren't, you will hardly notice the issue. Though if you play games involving multi-touch, this will be a problem for you. Strangely though, if you plug corded headphones into the jack, the problem stops, really weird. It does seem to just be a software bug though and Samsung should be able to fix the problem with an update patch. Unfortunately little problems like this are just part of the technological world we live in now and occasionally happens to the devices we use and they need to be updated. Other than that though... This tablet feels nice and light, runs fast and smooth with the upgraded processor and increased 8GB of RAM on the A9+ model, and the screen has a beautiful bright picture with nice deep and vibrant colors. I did a side by side HD video comparison with my A8 and the picture on the A9 is quite a noticeable improvement. And I see people saying that there's didn't come with a charger as if it's a mistake. It is not a mistake, Samsung doesn't send chargers with their products anymore. They say it's to minimize their impact on the environment or whatever, and also because I think they know most people have plenty of charging blocks and USB C cables laying around at this point being that so many products use them now, and if you don't you can buy one very cheap. With all that said, if you can deal with the current multi-touch problem until it's fixed, I highly recommend getting this tablet as everything else about it is great!","Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2024"
wjt,"My 2017 8"" A8 is getting long in the tooth. I've had some software incompatibility show up. Android 9 doesn't cut it anymore. The battery is also starting to lose charge a bit. The A9+ has Android 14 and a new battery, so those issues are gone. Everything seems to work according to Samsung's usual high standards. People in reviews seem to complain about slow charging. It's 2024 folks. My fast chargers have no problem charging it up in a few hours.

My one complaint is the size. 11 inches is great for sitting on a desktop and viewing things, but I have a television and a laptop for that. I miss the old A8's 8"" screen that allowed for comfortable hand-holding. Alas, even the new A8 is 10+ inches. I looked at other brands, but Samsung was still the best bet.","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024"

Whenever he's off, the other chefs can use the tablet to reference the dish in question. He also photographs new dishes and sends them to the owners to inquire on a possible new special.","Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024"
Sgt Ducttape,"This tablet has been doing very well for me. There is a transfer program built in that helps you step by step move your data from your old Samsung Galaxy Tab to this new one. The processor is very good, there is a plentiful amount of RAM, and there still are ports you can plug into. I got the ""HXCASEAC Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+/ A9 Plus Case 11 Inch"", and it is also the second time I've bought this case. Protective rubber, and a built in screen protector. Shamefully I was upgrading from a Tab 7, and probably wouldn't have done that if the batteries hadn't swollen and gotten hot. But back to this tablet. If you've had a Tab before, worry not, here things just got better. The colors, the feels, it's all there. I purchased a 1TB MicroSD card and it has a home in this Tab 9+. Beyond that I'm not sure what I can say about this Tab, oh yeah, it's from Samsung so it's full of Samsung goodness.","Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2024"

Carroll M,"I use my tablet constantly for playing games, having virtual Doctor's appointments, online shopping and online banking. It is very fast, fastest I've ever had actually, and it is so easy to use. I absolutely love how thin it is and lightweight. Because a lot of them are super heavy for what they are. I love that this has a 128 GB of storage. Cause I can have any app that I have Heart set on and I don't have to worry about anything going over. Or having backup storage. You can also use a microSD card with it. I have not needed to but I do own one if that is ever needed. Overall. This is the best tablet I've ever owned and I've owned a lot of different tablets over the years. I love this more than my previous iPad.

"JHR Installations, LLC","I was looking around for a Samsung tablet and found a variety of them priced all over the place. I ordered one for $79 and it ran out of memory very quickly. I was constantly deleting photos and music in order to have enough memory for my apps. I realized I needed something with a lot more memory.
I looked at some of the Samsung Tablets that cost as much as $800 before settling on the Samsung Tab A9+
It's probably not as good as the top of the line Samsung Tablets, but on the other hand it was only $199. and for that price it's a bargain.","Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2024"

The Bluescaster,"Best work tablet I've had, the only reason for taking off 1 star is the battery takes 2 or more hours to charge up from 30%, and it drains down to that in about 3 hours of use.
That's with a brand name rapid charger, and a high quality cable. As others have mentioned, the USB receptacle takes extra care to plug in firmly. A small hassle, but worth it to me for the overall performance.","Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2024"

jonathan,"I bought this to use as an inexpensive tablet I could use while backpacking. I was looking for something really basic that I could read at camp, check maps, and listen to music offline while hiking. Being a Samsung, it meant I would be able to find a decent case for it to provide at least some basic protection. If it got damaged during the hike, well... it was a cheap tablet so it should be good enough.

It had 55% battery when it arrived, so I plugged it into a USB-C cable I had plugged into the USB port on my wall outlet. I figured this would be alright since it would need to be charged from a portable power source in the field anyway. After 48 minutes, it managed to charge only to 64%! I wanted to err on it being my cable, so I plugged it into a USB-C power brick instead and put that in my outlet. My wall outlets are 20w, and this requires 15w to charge, so it should totally work.

It managed to hit 100% 4.5 hours later. Taking four and a half hours to charge anything 36% is insane. When I finally was able to power the tablet on, the screen was so dim, I could barely see anything. After rushing through the typical Android setup, I managed to increase the display brightness to around 50%. After installing 3 apps, I noticed that the battery was at 93% for less than a half hour of use.

I definitely do not recommend this tablet. The cons far outweigh the pros in this device, especially since finding a budget tablet is not really that hard to find these days.","Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2024"

The screen is several inches bigger than my S6 Lite but it's not too big.

RJ,"I've always had the best Galaxy tablets, the S series. Thought I'd try A series. Verdict: not quite as quick or sharp as S but overall satisfactory.

What you'll notice most: a little hesitation and jerkiness when you pinch or expand screen size with your fingers. Works better when you resize a little slower and smoother.

Update on 3/3/24: That ""hesitation and jerkiness"" when you use fingers to pinch/expand screen is worse than I thought, it's intolerable. I'm going to live with it, for now, but contrary to what I wrote I would not buy A9+ again. For $200 more I could have had the crispness, speed and smooth functionality of the S9.","Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2024"

I have had the tablet for a week and have no speed or input issues, and visually the tablet itself is sleek. I am using for work and have had no productivity issues sharing service and apps between my ZFold 3. I recommend purchase, I shopped around for two months and am happy with my choice. Will provide update in 6 months but anticipate no issues. Battery lasts roughly 32 hours on full charge with mid to full use each day. I am happy with that.

Lydia Woltz,"I bought so that I could use Smart View to Cast Dribbleup on to my Roku TV. I tried lower versions but they either didn't have a high enough Android OS (original (not updated) 12+ which messes up the dribbleup sound) or they didn't have SmartView software to wirelessly cast. I bought/returned about 3 samsungs before I found a good one and I didn't want a phone version just because it would have been too small without the TV. So this worked. The only thing is that I have to search for smartview when I'm in settings, I can't just scroll down to it like I'd like to.","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2024"

The CCIVV Stylus Pen 2 in 1 Fine Point & Mesh Tip Stylus for Touch Screen, Compatible for Tablet and Cellphone works great with the tablet.","Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024"

Daniel Caldwell,"I really like this tablet. It's fast, the screen is big and clear. Also, since I have a Samsung phone, it quickly moved all of my apps over to the tablet. The sound also is really good. I purchased it to mainly watch movies, and stream shows from my apps. So the clarity is good, the sound is good. Surfing the internet with Wi-Fi has been quick also. Quality and price cannot be beat.","Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024"

Alan H,"My husband has the earlier version of this tablet. I would walk by and see him enjoying using it. That said, I really wanted it for music and solitaire and reading the news with these older eyes and just surfing for stuff. Got it, loaded it up ( took a while)and after 2 days of use, asked myself...."" what took you so long to get one""? Its wonderful. The sound quality is amazing and the screen quality.....perfect. Went back for a really pretty girlie case to have it sit on my lap. Who needs a "" apple""? Not me. Thank you !!!!","Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2024"

My kindle app has all my books. I can manage my bills on this, I can listen to music or even watch a movie. It's lightweight, after charging it the first time I didn't have to charge it again for 9 days. So far it's great.","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2024"

Jerome McDonald,"This tablet is really big and runs smooth. I have zero complaints, the camera isn't the best of the best but who buys a tablet for the camera. The performance, battery life, screen resolution are top notch. You won't be disappointed.

I want to mention though that this is a Wi-Fi only version of the tab A9 Plus so you can't use a physical SIM card nor an e Sim.","Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2024"
Alice 41,"Good size, price, and performance. Wish the little set-up leaflet had more explicit instructions. If I were not a long-term Samsung and android user, I'm not sure set-up would have gone well. Overall I am satisfied and would recommend. I have zero interest in games, so can't speak to that aspect.","Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024"
Kenny,I have had the A9+ now for 10 days so I have got a good feel for it and as far as tablets under $250 this will be tough to beat. I love the big screen that comes with it. It's great for Netflix and YouTube or anything else like that. You don't get 4K with this tablet but 1080 is more than good enough. You get great audio and the battery life is exceptional. On a full charge you get 2 days of use and thats with me heavily using it. I recommend getting the 128 gb version of this tablet given its a tremendous value. If you are use to using a laptop or a PC this tablet comes equipped with Samsung Dex which gives you that same look and feel so that's a big plus. Overall it's a really good tablet for the price that comes with a lot of bells and whistles you see with a expensive tablet. I highly recommend!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024"
V,"Excellent Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ with 64 GB, quad speakers...Netflix is now sound-tastic!...this upgrade was under $200! Awesome features and speed. Also, the easiest set-up using the android Smart Switch that transferred data from my Samsung Tab A (version 2017) to the Samsung Tab A9+ (version 2023)...woohoo! Go Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ for an under $200 price tag...a Galaxy not so far away after all.","Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2024"

Rose,"It's okay if you're just using it to tinker around on. Battery isn't all that great. I was on it for an hour and a half starting from 100% and it is now 78%. My phone last longer than that. I like Samsung, that's what my phone is, I just think they could have done better with this. I think the price is a little to high for a 2023 and no more than what it is.","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2024"
