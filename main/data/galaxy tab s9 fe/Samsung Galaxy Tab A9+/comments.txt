Spent several days, many hours with Samsung tech support, there they literally told me that they cannot update my phone number no matter what, against their policy, which means I cannot sign in to my account no matter what, ever.

That said, an SD slot is far more convenient, be it  a lot slower than an SSD drive.    At this point, we had SSD drives that are pretty darn small and can be attached right to the back of a device offering 1, 2 or even 4 TB&#39;s of storage dirt cheap.  The world of tablets continues to get better.   Start with apps you want.  Android is useless if your favorite app isn&#39;t supported!

It has been untouched for more than 4 years now) and is so unconfortable to use, give it a try to the S pen and you will never look back at the Apple pencil. Apple Notes is trash if you are a serious note-taker (writing two words on a screen does not account as serious note-taking).
