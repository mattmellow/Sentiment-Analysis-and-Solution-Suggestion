ipad >>><<< It is designed to meet requirements for certain Android users Not to compete with ipad >>><<< Almost bought one ofnthese Couldnt believe they onlynoffer 128gb and no SD card Thats really the only reason i didnt buy one >>><<< Regarding the words at the beginning I can attest I have a friend who is full on Android Hates Apple to the core But he still uses an iPad for a tablet because the competition is just not there To me this tablet is a step closer if not just because of the aspect ratio I never realized how ideal the ratio is on iPads until I picked up a Galaxy tab So awkward to hold that standard 169 >>><<< When comparing iPad with the top of the competition Apple loses in terms of value for money It is not a rational choice >>><<< Companies need to start making windows tablet It is so much better at opening multiple windows of the same app and it would be great for both work and personal use and make the price more affordable >>><<< No person with a sane mind will buy an ipad >>><<< im samsung fan and im not shy to say it but this is some good of tablet if im buying one i will consider this 100percent >>><<< No one will ever kill or even match the iPad Its the goat and the king of tablets >>><<< As much as i love an iPad the thing that really annoys me is that there is no multiple users feature like on Android It really is just designed for 1 individual In my household none of us need a tablet enough to warrant a tablet each but we do like a single tablet laying around in the living room should you need it Having multiple users ability on android just makes it easier for all your own accounts to be signed in instantly such as emails photos etc for quick access And should someone else want to use it after they have their own profile and all their settings apps etc saved >>><<< Need a iPad Mini competitor pleeeeeaaaaseeeee >>><<< Poor mans iPad lol >>><<< Clone >>><<< They should of allowed user replacable battery and they should of never got rid of the finger print scanner In the UK you can only buy the 128gb version 128gb in 2024 with no expandable storage Just seriously >>><<< Im watching this on an iPad >>><<< When anyone means Tablet he says iPad Android User or Apple User nearly everyone says iPad >>><<< MarcusI use the iPad 6 for homework youtube games and other stuff what iPad should I switch to Ive had this for 5 years >>><<< There are no such thing as iphone killer or ipad killer Apple is being sued for having a monopoly Their iphone and ipad are not just original products but best in class their hardware and software is 12 years ahead of any tech company this is a fact >>><<< I think its both an ipad killer and a clone >>><<< Now that the smallest model Galaxy Tab S has an OLED its easily the best android tablet on the market My entire tech ecosystem is Apple but they didnt have a OLED iPad so I went with the Galaxy and Im so glad I did It definitely filled the void left behind after my Note 20 Ultra broke >>><<< Love how powerful it is have had it 6 weeks and have had no issues with game lag at all the built in performance bar is amazing I record my games and edit them through that Only downside is the battery life but I got a power bank it its working great together Overall very amazing tablet for gaming and cheaper then most so budget friendly and you can game with best performances Thank you love it >>><<< It is an excellent tablet it has a good screen brightness it is very fast to open applications 100percent recommended >>><<< After getting it all setup for my needs I can say I am very happy with this tablet I do not use or care about the pen which seemed to be a problem to others but as far as gaming and watching videos it rocks the refresh rate made the movies pop and were visually crisp I got the 8gb256gb version but I still wanted more storage I solved that with a USBC SD card reader I found one with USB TypeC port and 5Gbps Data rate for under ten dollars and it is as small as a Wireless USB mouse dongle The wireless is fast and I have had no issues with it or the bluetooth both have been flawless so far browsing and gaming run buttery smooth >>><<< The 300 PPI screen is great for reading technical PDFs The video watching experience is worse than on an OLED screen for obvious reasons Everything works fast and smoothly Battery life so far has been great But there are two flaws in my opinion 1 There is visible vignetting at the edges of the screen 2 The UI is much worse than say Samsung Its hard to get to the list of open apps It takes me 510 attempts on average to get this done The floating windows feature is annoying and cannot be turned off >>><<< Its honestly better than I expected for the price it has good specs and so far no hiccups >>><<< Legit global rom confirmed w serial number Includes a 33 watt charger >>><<< It is a very solid tablet for the price The finishes are high and the materials are durable and somewhat luxurious compared to its price Its screen size and stereo sound are of very good quality this is incredible for watching series playing video games and more multimedia things However the only negative side would be the battery life but this is offset by Xiaomis fast charging I consider this tablet to be a solid product just like its predecessor the Xiaomi pad 5 >>><<< Very good price quality but it is not good for gaming like Fortnite or Genshin Impact >>><<< The truth is that this tablet is excellent in terms of qualityprice it is the second one I have bought both supplier and excellent product The only detail on this occasion was that they sent me a charger that is not the correct input >>><<< Purchase and shipping I purchased the Tablet via Pix on 01242024 After payment confirmation I received the tracking code that allowed tracking via the Correios website The timeline for this followup looked like this 0126 Object posted in China 0131 Object received by Correios do Brasil at the International Center in Curitiba 0502 Electronic information sent for analysis by the customs authority 0902 Analysis completed Import authorized 0902 Customs inspection completed awaiting payment 0215 Payment confirmed 0217 Departure from the International Center towards my state So Paulo 0219 Object arrives in So Paulo 0220 Object delivered to recipient Taking the entire process into account it took less than 1 month to arrive at my home Unboxing and product If you have knowledge about processors and tabletsmartphone components you know that this device is a real machine An excellent value for money But leaving aside this technical information the product arrived well packaged and sealed When you open it you come face to face with the tablet which is well protected In the box there are instruction manuals a USB TypeC cable and a 33W power supply When you turn on the device you already notice that the screen is incredibly beautiful with excellent definition The sound is loud and clear and the fluidity of the device tells you that it is a product that will last a long time The product was a birthday gift for my mother and she will use it more to watch streaming content Pros Great value for money Excellent screen Fast and fluid Cons It doesnt come with a protective film I suggest buying a glass one that will protect more than the hydrogel ones Read more >>><<< Bought as a replacement for my iPad This one broke after many years I didnt have to make any effort to get used to this Android pad The screen quality is great and even better than that of the iPad Specifications of this tablet easily beat those of the iPad But significantly cheaper than the iPad The modified MI version of Android is great Effortlessly switch from iOS to this tablet It was a difficult decision but I dont regret it at all This tablet can do much if not everything that the Apple has >>><<< Excellent product really nice fast and responsive At this price its a monster it doesnt heat up and it also does gaming very well >>><<< The Xiaomi Pad 6 is a tablet that has exceeded all my expectations offering an exceptional user experience in all aspects With a storage capacity of 256GB this tablet provides more than enough space to store a large number of applications games multimedia files and much more One of the most notable aspects of the Xiaomi Pad 6 is its impressive speed which even though it is not the

iPad the Xiaomi Pad 6 offers a significant improvement in terms of performance screen and sound quality and battery that charges it in no time and lasts much longer than the iPad I had to buy The battery was still in good condition and it took forever to charge Honestly if you are not tied to an Apple ecosystem and do not want to spend more than euros400 it is the smartest purchase Xiaomi put me off with its software >>><<<  I have had highend mobile phones from the brand whose customization layer hindered the experience a lot but on tablets at least it works very well plus it has already been updated to Hyper OS and it is also working very well In conclusion the Xiaomi Pad 6 is one of the best qualityprice purchases on the market in terms of tablets With its impressive speed dazzling display and immersive sound this tablet offers an exceptional user experience that far exceeds expectations If you are looking for a powerful and versatile tablet that will not disappoint you the
