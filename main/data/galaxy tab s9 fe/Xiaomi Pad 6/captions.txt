this is xiaomi's new latest tablet from them it is called the xiaomi pad 6 Pro the top spec version now it's at the time of this video only an exclusive Chinese release I hope it's going to be Global but we might only see the xiaomi pad 6 unfortunately it's very thin it's light it's got a lot of power great battery life so many things going for it so let's find out why I think this model definitely needs a global release so this unit I got from giztop and I'm really surprised by their shipping came with DHL and it only took three days amazingly quick so we get this paperwork here that is in Chinese of course this being the domestic model here it's not Global just yet I hope it is going to be Global and especially this pro model a 67 watt charger so it fully charges the tablet in just one hour and that is their claim but I get just over that it's not bad at all for a 8 600 milliamp hour battery and of course the cable so that's what is included there is no SIM tray tool because there's no sim support so I'm really liking the build quality of this xiaomi pad 6 Pro this is a matte finish on the back of it the middle the alloy feels really good the edges aren't too sharp they're not super rounded off either and then we've got of course our 15 megapixel camera right here there's a mic on the rear dual tone LED flash and two megapixel depth camera so great that it's not a two megapixel macro that really has no point but the depth camera is to help out with the portrait shots so three Pogo Port pin connectors right here for the attachable optional keyboard there's also an optional stylus now this review unit did not come from xiaomi that I've got right here and unfortunately I don't have the keyboard or the stylus it just wasn't ready in time giztop did not have it now I've got some super exciting news that I am so happy about and I'm going to use it and I have been and that is the type C Port here yes finally you guessed it it does support video out so we don't have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and no micro SD but we've gained that video out and it is USB 3.2 now it's only the five gigabits per second but I'll take that over USB 2 speeds any day microphone here we've got two of our loudspeakers and these are Dolby Atmos they do support they'll be at most the screen also does support Dolby Vision so you can see on the other side there they are and it's marking there the Dolby Vision Dolby Atmos now this is not a SIM tray sadly this model unlike the previous it does not have SIM support so no network connectivity with it this is a capacitive always on fingerprint reader slash power button there is face unlocking with a 20 megapixel camera right here and it does seem to work pretty well but remember it's not that secure but the fingerprint reader is and this is working really well so I've enabled through the settings that this to touch it to enable it which can sometimes trigger some accidental ones but I simply just tap it and you'll see there it goes and unlocks just like that now that isn't the fastest I have seen from a fingerprint reader but it's not bad I'll do that one more time so touching it now all right that was a lot quicker that was under a second and the bezels they're not bad at all okay with it now the tablet is light it is just 490 grams and the thickness is the best part I think it is 6.5 millimeters now you see up here we have a blank here now that's not anything it's not a button it's not a SIM tray that's probably where the SIM tray would be if they did have the network support with it so we've got microphones here and a metal volume and up and down button now these buttons do not rattle they have a very good feel to it so overall the build quality is excellent from the xiaomi pad 6 Pro our display here is an IPS now 144 Hertz is the refresh rate now I do have this widget enabled through the developer options because I want to look at the frame rate and the refresh rate now I've been monitoring this and I can happily report here yes it is 144 Hertz and it is running at normally 144 frames per second you see the occasional dip down to like 135 or something like that but it's normal that is going to happen on any tech there so that is just fine there now looking at the screen brightness is 450 Nets is what I'm measuring just over that they claim it's 550 so I'm not able to quite get that it could be down to my panel or it could be that they've just upped that result a little bit that could be also my measuring equipment but it's good it's a bright screen looks great now when you look at it at certain angles because it's an IPS you're going to see this slightly darker edges to it so there is that now if it was OLED or an AMOLED screen which personally I would have preferred this to have been it wouldn't have this issue the colors would be a little bit more uniformed so what you're looking at is the out of the box here configuration the colors so what they do have set is the the vibrant mode so I'll just go sorry into our display settings here and I'll just show you that so you can see the UI performance is really good everything's running fantastic really really fast so it's 128 gigabytes ufs 3.1 storage and 8 gigabytes of RAM time that I do have with us but non-expandable now you see here uh the different modes we've got so color scheme you can adjust that oh it's original color Pro that I do have it on sorry you've got Vivid then saturated so if you want something that mimics a little bit like an OLED screen then just whack it into uh saturated there but no it's a very good screen I'm happy with it now in direct sunlight you'll you'll struggle a little bit with it with that 400 and about 58 or so nits that I'm measuring it's all right it's fine and indoors will you'll probably be using the tablet no it's looking really good now it does run Android 13 and we have MIUI pad they call it 14 so this is specific to the tablets and as I just said before the performance is excellent now I believe and I've experienced this with all my reviews of xiaomi products that the Chinese ROMs seem to just have the best performance overall they really seem to just be a bit faster they don't show that little spinning icon when you unlock things it all seems to this pop up really quick there so you can see there that it's a new iPad 14.0 0.3 there was one update that I'll show you later on for it and storage here I don't have an amazing amount so I'd probably be better off at least with my own needs to get the 256 gigabyte model but no it's been really quick gestures touch is working quite well and they do have a few features here that they've customized for tablets so they've got their kids space keywords for tablet you can go through but I just run gboard here and floating windows you can do split screen all of that good stuff we do of course have and I'll just go into Chrome here for example and show you like you can set this up as split screen so you can just hold it here and go there you go I want to have it on one side here then bring up my gallery that's possible and again when you're using both of them at least with chrome here because it's reasonably lightweight it's very fluid and still we are managing to pump out yeah 144 frames per second although it's just telling me 60 now depends on the content so this here the album has gone to 60 oh no there we go since I touched it it's gone back up to 144. so it is a variable reflex refresh rate which I will also show you there too so I forgot to mention that just before about our display do apologize for that very important so refresh rate override I always just force it to 144 I want that performance but this is really good I'm so happy that I'm sitting here and saying this look they have 90 Hertz The Sweet Spot so if you want that battery life but you don't want to take a huge hit on it of course we're only 144 but you still want things to be smooth it's definitely 90 Hertz you want to run with this tablet so the UI their performance I'm not really seeing any lag everything seems to be great and I'm loving this I can't believe I'm actually saying this this MIUI version this is good this is very good what I'm seeing out of this Chinese ROM so it's not Global and it doesn't come with Google Play installed but you can install it yourself now the tablet does not have any flicker it doesn't suffer from that issue you won't see any banding or any flick or any problems you get that with the OLED screens AMOLED screens but this is IPS so we're not suffering from the pulse width modulation issue that some of you do have the latest patch here so we have a security patch level of April now so we are up to date and here this is what the ROM is like after you remove all the Chinese bloatware so yes there is quite a bit there's all these different Chinese apps on there but when you clean it up just remove here Netflix wasn't there Amazon Prime video and gentian those are my Omen stalls there but once you get rid of that you are basically bloatware free I think it's even better here than the global ROMs from xiaomi that tend to be quite bloated this doesn't seem to be as bad and a lot of things you can just completely get rid of so it does have a wide Vine level one cert so this means well Netflix is going to be in full HD Disney plus Amazon Prime video and Netflix I've been watching a lot of on this tablet because I love the size of it being 11 inches very comfortable and only 490 grams it's great I think for just media consumption like that so full HD but we don't have HDR support now this is an HDR 10 supporting tablet it also does have Dolby Vision but for some reason Netflix is not recognizing that so maybe that'll be fixed when the global version does come out I really do hope so battery life phenomenal super good here I think it's because of I don't know various factors probably the IPS screen but more but probably because of just the optimization of this ROM really good and an 8 600 milliamp hour battery is a decent size for an 11 inch tablet so what I'm looking at is around about 9 to 10 hours is what you can squeeze out of this thing and even just using it over a few days and use it a few hours every day the battery drain the standby battery drain has been excellent really good and it drops down a little bit and when you're watching video I've been watching a lot of Netflix has mentioned it really hardly loses anything so the battery life is great I only probably need to charge this maybe once a year five days or so and that's using it every day a few hours now stress testing it this is the 20 minute very demanding graphically that is Benchmark the loops and Loops from 3dmark Wildlife extreme test and look at this it only throttled down not even four percent brilliant really good you see this when you game and I have my gaming test coming up soon that The Thermals are great doesn't seem to really throttle at all and they've done a very good job there with the cooling of the Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 with this 11 inch tablet now internal storage very quick this says ufs 3.1 so yeah it's not ufs 4.0 the latest and greatest uh but you need the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for that of course but these speeds no one's going to be complaining about them I mean look at the random reads and writes they are very good and there is no layer coming from this tablet when you're installing or loading your applications or even just viewing your gallery with a lot of photos and apps and different documents there's no lag with that at all so a very respectable great score here we are looking at Flagship performance still even though yes it's the last gen chip so just over a million points here for our antutu score that's great and it only went up 3.9 degrees Celsius losing three percent battery three very good result here a great use of this tablet is this too as well so ebooks PDF files I will just jump into this which is quite a heavy uh file here that is running now through this PDF file through Google Books and you can see here I'll just dismiss that it wants me to go over into the night mode the performance is excellent now this is not still quite iPad level when it comes to heavy PDF files I don't think they'll ever be able to match that but it still does really good it plays a little bit of catch up so holding it and portrait comfortable it's only the 400 of course and 90 grams and really I have found it to be a great device here for ebooks and PDFs so have a look now quickly at a eBook and this is great it does look good the text is sharp I don't find I really strain my eyes and do remember that you can invert the text so you can have the background black the text white if you find that a little bit more comfortable you can put a blue light filter on and you can also make this all grayscale and just change a few things there to make it even more comfortable so as an ebook reader it is fantastic for that a little bit Overkill too with that kind of performance every Gamers out there you've got fantastic performers here with the xiaomi pad 6 Pro it's very good so I have it on the highest visual settings here again chain impact and you can see the frame rate well it's 60 frames per second normally solid I do sometimes see it occasionally dipped to 51 51 or 50 is the lowest that I have seen with this game which is great and yes I do realize I'm not in a super built up area so it could lag a little bit more but this is probably one of the best kind of performances you're going to see out of a tablet with this price point here so great for gamers great gaming performance and because of the Quad speakers very immersive great audio and just in general I love gaming on the xiaomi pad 6 Pro and what about our audio so we have the four speakers on this side and if you are holding it like so and you're watching for example some YouTube videos you can accidentally block at least two of those speakers but I don't find it to be too much of an issue now of course if you've got a tablet stand you'll use that or if you have the keyboard you can use that instead and these speakers here so they are Adobe audio speakers the four of them quite loud reasonable amount of bass well just a little bit meds are fine they're actually pretty good speakers for an 11 inch tablet so I'll give you a sample of them but just before I do this is YouTube playback here at 1080p I've set it to the higher picture quality in fact no that's 4K that it is currently playing right now and look at it it's smooth it's fine it does not seem to be dropping any frames per second because it's running at 29 to 30 frames per second here but anyway here's a sample of the four speakers oh so those speakers they sound really good good volume to them xiaomi overall they have done an excellent job with the quad speakers we get with the pad 6 Pro and over to the video now you can expect out of the xiaomi pad 6 Pro so this is the front facing camera 1080p 30 frames per second or 60 frames per second yes 60 is there now the audio sounds a little bit scratchy we do have yet again that 96 kilobits per second audio bitrate uh they've gone back to that now and then the rear camera this is our 50 megapixel sand so you can shoot 4K quality doesn't seem to be quite as good as their phones but for a tablet it's not too bad here the focus seems to be fine no real issues with it and it does have electronic image stabilization so just like the front facing camera you can see that the focus yeah no problems with it so not bad video quality for a tablet so xiaomi has done a lot of things right with this model so first off I've got to mention it is finally finally finally yes we have video out via the type C port and USB 3.2 it's only five gigabits per second but hey I'll take that over USB 2 specs any day so the screen IPS it does show a little bit of dark edges around the corners but overall it's not a bad screen super responsive to touch and I think most people are going to be very happy with it it doesn't have any flickering or any of those problems you get with oleds or amoleds 144 Hertz and even a 90 Hertz Sweet Spot option performance is fantastic the Chinese rhyme here while it only has English and Chinese it's really well optimized none of that little spinning loading the UI icons no none of that it's just spot on performance is great and it seems to be bug free which is a rarity especially when I review the global ROMs of MIUI but no this one is fantastic build quality fantastic very good great loudspeakers really good performance for gamers out there and then the loudspeakers they are also impressive and it will fully charge in just over an hour for me around about an hour and eight minutes we'll charge the 8 600 milliamp hour batteries it takes so many boxes but it's not Global no micro SD card no 3.5 millimeter headphone jack sadly and it does not have 5G or 4G support pricing of the global version if we get it I hope it's closer to the Chinese pricing but it'll likely be quite a bit higher so thank you so much for watching my review here of this fantastic Android 13 tablet from xiaomi the xiaomi pad 6 ProLast year when the Xiaomi Pad arrived, it kind of spiced things up in the Android tablet market and now this is here. This is the new Xiaomi Pad 6 and what's interesting, is that this brings some nice upgrades while keeping a killer price. Let me show you. First off, the Xiaomi Pad 6 has a more premium design now. Unlike the plastic back in the last gen, the Pad 6 has an all metal design, be it the back, the frame and this is a tablet that feels very high-end. It's also sleeker than the Pad 5. It's 20 grams lighter at 490 grams, it's 0.34mm slimmer at 6.51mm and ya, this looks and feels better. Now, functionality-wise, this has these magnetic connectors for the upgraded pen and the keyboard. The buttons are clicky and nice. There are still quad speakers here with hi-res audio and Dolby Atmos support and these speakers are still room-filling and awesome. Now, the Pad 6, just like the last gen, does not have a fingerprint scanner, there's just face unlock and there's also no microSD slot, no headphone jack, no LTE variant. But there's one upgrade that I honestly did not expect. I'm talking about the fact that the USB-C port here is USB 3.2. Now to give you an idea, even the higher priced OnePlus Pad has a USB 2.0 port. Now if you're wondering what difference does this make, well, for starters, the USB 3.2 port brings faster data transfer speeds. See, I copied the same 8GB file from an SSD to Xiaomi Pad 6 and the OnePlus Pad and on the Xiaomi Pad 6, the file was copied in 48 seconds, while the OnePlus Pad, it took 5 minutes 24 seconds. That is a huge difference. That's not all, the USB 3.2 port here means that you can connect this tablet to a 4K display or a 4K TV using an HDMI to Type-C cable and that's actually pretty useful. Anyway, coming back to the expected upgrades, the display is still 11 inches but it's higher res at 2.8K, it has a faster refresh rate at 144Hz and slightly brighter at 550 nits. Now, I really liked the display on the last gen Xiaomi Pad and this is slightly better. Videos look great on this panel, be it the colors, the contrast and since this has a 16:10 inch aspect ratio, there isn't a lot of letterboxing in movies and shows. The display is also good to use in outdoorish situations. Look, this display is great but I wouldn't say it has changed a lot. Yes, it has the 144Hz refresh rate, but most of the time, the UI is locked to 120Hz and when you play videos, it goes to 60Hz or 30Hz depending on the video, and it's only supported games that you get the full 144Hz refresh rate experience. Now, one of the things that I really liked about the Xiaomi Pad 5 was the MIUI for pad experience and I like that on the Pad 6, Xiaomi hasn't changed a lot of things. First of all, this has MIUI 14 based on Android 13 and I like that there's absolutely no bloatware, here just like the Pad 5. This is the home screen after I set up the tablet for the first time and apart from Netflix, there's no bloatware whatsoever. It's a clean experience. Apart from that, I also noticed no ads, so it's really good and I like that there's all the features, I liked on the Pad 5. You get the nice dual pane UI in most apps, you get the same useful dock here that is available everywhere and lets you drag and drop apps to split screen, put apps in a floating window. It's very very useful and I like that you can save app pairs now to launch them side by side quickly. There's also this gesture to put an app into split screen. Now, there is one interesting new feature, I'm talking about this continue task feature which is like continuity on iPads and iPhones, but this is in beta and limited to Xiaomi 13 Pro which we don't have right now, so ya. Now, one area where I'm a little doubtful is updates. See, Xiaomi has promised 3 years of security patches for the Xiaomi Pad 6 and that's fine, but there's no word on OS updates which is a little strange. Anyway, what's not strange is that the Pad 6 gets a processor upgrade. The new Pad 6 is powered by the Snapdragon 870 processor which is a good upgrade to the 860 and the RAM is also now LPDDR5 and the storage is UFS 3.1. Now, these upgraded specs show in the higher benchmark scores of the tablet, be it Antutu or Geekbench and I really like the performance here. I mean, you already saw how smooth the tablet was when using the dock, the split screen gestures and even gaming is very good. Games like Asphalt run very well and I liked that games like BGMI run on the highest graphics settings and gameplay is mostly smooth and good. The accessories too have gotten slight upgrades. First of all, Xiaomi has promised that these will be available to buy, unlike the last time when it just wasn't available. And second, like I said, they have gotten some improvements. The new Xiaomi smart pen looks and feels the same. It has the same two buttons that let you quickly take a note, change the pen style, change the pen color. You can also press hold on this to take a screenshot like this. Now, this is all good, but what's insane is that the new pen has a rated battery life of 150 hours compared to 8 hours on the last gen. I have no idea how Xiaomi is doing this. Also, it charges magnetically on the tablet and one minute of charge is set to bring 7 hours of backup. I know, crazy. That's not all, the latency has also been improved and honestly, this is really good to use. The Xiaomi keyboard remains the same. It attaches magnetically and it has nice travel in the keys and it has support for useful keyboard shortcuts. You can even create custom shortcuts, but ya, a touchpad built into this would be obviously better. Now, apart from all this, the rear camera remains the same 13MP sensor, which takes fine photos. The front camera also remains the same 8MP ultra wide angle camera. And it is pretty good for calls in classes, especially with the four mics. The battery is slightly bigger at 8,840mAh battery, and you get the same 33W fast charger. Now, the battery life is pretty good. We got a screen time of 6 hours with 11% battery left, and that is with the screen set to Max brightness. The keyboard attached all the time and that is with heavy usage. So that's pretty good. The charging speed is also pretty good. The 33W charger takes the tablet to 50% in around 45 minutes and fully charges it in 1 hour 43 minutes, which is fine for a tablet. Look, let's face it, the Xiaomi Pad 5 was still a very good tablet under 30K, but now the Xiaomi Pad 6 is here. And this brings some nice upgrades, making things even better. But what's really awesome is that Xiaomi has kept the same killer pricing as last year. Honestly, at a starting price of Rs 26,999/-, this is the ultimate value for money Android tablet. Yes, there's still no LTE variant. Xiaomi hasn't really clarified on the OS updates. But even with all this, this is the absolute best Android tablet under 30K. Anyway, I want to know from you guys, what do you think of the Xiaomi Pad 6 and this pricing? Comment down below and thanks for watching.so this time around this is the xiaomi pad 6 Pro this is the pro variant 6 series the xiaomi pad and by far uh globally and I do hope so this is probably one of the most powerful uh tablet I've ever had experienced it [Music] so you have a pretty white box over here and what I got here is the 12 gigs of RAM and 256g of storage and the color is black so let's unbox so let's open the box so pretty nice packaging this time around so yeah and yeah I'll try the pad is quite light I kind of like the packaging this time around remember this design looks like the xiaomi 13 Pro looks like a charging terminal to me and the xiaomi logos here so we have the volume rocker over here a microphone here this one seems to be a magnet for xiaomi pen so underneath you have dual speakers over here a microphone and of course your type c port on this side it's pretty clean two more speakers over here and the power button and it's being powered by Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos so some more other stuff inside the box we have your user guide type c cable 67 watts of fast charging great First Time xiaomi Pad 6 Pro and what's nice Tito Scania is quite large younger than screen and of course this one has a very nice display another takeaway this is a tablet is this one is being powered by Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos so definitely the enjoyment details entertainment is has one of the most powerful the processor I've seen in a tablet so this one has the Snapdragon 8 plus gen one and by Fara I'm really impressed performance mind-blowing us Benchmark 1.29 million points so once I predictor must score this is what you can see and I is about split screenshot checking other Benchmark like 3D Mark and eternavascript under thermal throttling test for 20 minutes and you know Auto for four straight times score it has throttle to 92 percent all green so for sure this one can perform really really well even it's a gaming tablet is an 11 incher IPS LCD 144hz screen refresh rate hdr10 plus support and I'm gonna maximum brightness detail is at 500 15 minutes this one is being protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Sahara browsing on social media looks something like this thanks smooth yeah guys to be honest with you probably one of the smoothest tones for a tablet so if you're browsing the maditas of Facebook equally nice smooth smooth scrolling as long as you have a very stable internet connection I don't think so this is kind of refresh rate either you can use 1690 or 144 or 40 I would highly suggest it Turtles AI image has a massive 8600 milliampere hours of battery quite larger and what's surprisingly though is this one is weighing at around 490 grams it's quite light for a tablet of this size for 67 watts of fast charging and charging from 10 to 100 ticks an hour and 20 minutes now if you ask me did last a whole day on normal usage yes Call of Duty mobile and playing this game I would say in a so Bronx smooth uh gameplay and I can still kind of touch response is also good as a big screen while playing I would highly recommend a comma controller but uh but holding this one game play but the experience is definitely pretty solid technically so I was able to enjoy honestly unlocking the screen and why the screen nice and of course some kind of sound is really enjoyable this one has a 50 MP the rear camera sensor together with a 2mp and depth sensor it can shoot up to 4K and 16.20 MP in a front-facing camera which can shoot up to 1080P and 60 FPS now picture using my tablets is for demonstration purpose and I was able to take some really nice snap on outdoor condition tablet that has a very nice camera just like this one imagine on Gundam and bring it indoors it was able to snap in some really nice one as well and even though the major low light okay and to be honest with you can confrontation camera I was able to snap in some really nice one it's an outdoor condition and indoor conditions using the front station camera [Music] only so right now I'm sitting indoors at 1080P and 60 FPS and I can see that this camera is really capable probably one of the best on the title on any tablet under your camera is one of the best things so check it out xiaomi part 6 Pro using the rear camera so guys I can see I'm camera NATO foreign 256 is priced at 27 000 pesos link on the

more elegant and look like an iPad Pro and here are some of the samples taken with rear camera and xiaomi Pad 6 is available in two colors which is graphite gray and Mist Blue and also xiaomi pad 6 supports bigger screens add HDMI to type c cable with the support you can convert your monitor into a smart TV and enjoy 4K videos with 60 FPS not only that this is really helpful when you want to present anything from the tablet on a bigger screen and also xiaomi pad 6 has one unique feature that is Smartphone Link in which you can just drag and drop a photos from your phone to xiaomi pad 6 but this is really restricted to only xiaomi phones and hopefully xiaomi will extend these features to other phones as well when it comes to tablets we really focus on the software rather than on the hardware and we want our tablets to be run smooth fluid no Jitters and no lag while playing games or watching movies we also want a tablet that can handle multitasking without any problem but this time xiaomi taking a different approach they are not only focusing on the software but they are also providing a specific Hardware accessories that can enhance the tablet experience and this is a great move by xiaomi this shows that they are really thinking about the user experience to make it better this keyboard case from xiaomi attaches to this three pin due to which there is no need for Paving and you can start typing immediately keys are nice and smooth and the build quality is premium and feels like a leather shortcuts like text selection by holding shift key copy and paste move between screens Escape all works like a regular keyboard if you want a proper tablet experience you can detach in a second and you are good to go but the keyboard with a tracking pad would have been given even a better experience this brings to our next accessory that is xiaomi pen second generation xiaomi pen second generation has matte finish nice grip it can be attached to xiaomi pad 6 on top like this get this little quick pop-up showing the battery percentage and xiaomi claims this with one charge it can last up to 150 hours of battery and it has two buttons If you long press the back button you can take a screenshot if you long press the front button you can take a quick notes and within the notes you can move around the pens by clicking the front button and you can choose the Colors by clicking the back buttons and it has a 4096 level pressure sensitivity by applying gentle pressure you get a thin line as you press harder you get the darker and wider line and here you can write notes do your creative stuff like painting drawing sketches but the keyboard comes at rupees 4999 which is a bit expensive with this cost I would have expected easily a trackpad and a pen cost 599 this is also I feel a bit expensive they must have included some other functionalities like gesture functionalities and all at this cost and we will definitely have a another detailed review because there are more to talk on these accessories in a separate video and one of the main purpose of a tablet is multitasking and quick accessing of the tools for example if you are working on a productivity tool and you need to calculate something you can just swipe up either of these sides take the calculator and leave on the screen which works like a floating window after it's used you can just drag to either of these edges of the tablet to minimize similarly if you are watching a tutorial on YouTube and you want to take a quick note you can swipe up and drag the note app to either of it just will do one and also you can slide this left and right to make it decal small screen as per your convenience and the best part is until you close windows it saves the split windows in the memory and you can access them again with a single touch and when it comes to gaming xiaomi pad 6 with the Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos sound with the quad speakers which will give you an immersive experience of gaming and we have texted with Asphalt 9 dbmi use sniper I didn't find even a single thing drop while playing speakers will give you an immersive experience to a level but dgmi and pure sniper were running on 144hz and as part 9 was always running on 60hz though the tablet is for 144 has display but the majority of the use I have seen it's ranging from only 60 to 120 heads only even if I that the 144 heads display but this is not expected because xiaomi advertises a lot on 144 has display but majority of the time I haven't seen 144 heads but the xiaomi pad 6 is available only in Wi-Fi variant and it is available in India at 26 triple 9. overall this budget friendly Rich feature tablet coupled with accessories will definitely enhance your productivity and make your entertainment experience better and all the links are in the below description and if you want a case without any keyboard then you can go for this this has also have a pen stand here and if you are using not using then there is a stand also like this you can keep it this is comes around 800 which is is good it feels leather but keyboard will give you a better experience if you are more of productivity purpose if you are buying a tablet please let me know in the comments below section about your thoughts on this tablet please like share and subscribe to get more stuff like this thanks for watching and catch you in the next video foreignxiaomi Patrick is it an iPad on a budget I won't bore you with this specifications let's just get straight to the point you can pause the video right now if you're into the specs part but now let me share my experience with you I'll be honest I was very skeptical at first especially when I saw the xiaomi smart pen it wasn't really a surprise that they were going for the iPad yesterday xiaomi has been known for delivering high quality products at a fraction of a price the xiaomi pad 6 is again no such exception to that it's been touted as the budget friendly alternative to the iPad but can it really hold its own against the Apple's Powerhouse in case you are new over here hey guys my name is I'm an electronic music producer a part-time gamer and I also try to make videos considering the price point the path 6 really looks premium it has an all metal finish at the back and at the sides from the back it really has an iPad like white to be honest I've been using the iPad Pro for many years now when I held this in my hand for the first time my first reaction was I really like the size of it it's more reasonable and it makes more sense for day-to-day travel it just really feels great in my hands to be honest unlike my iPad I've been using this tablet vertically I did a lot of reading on the pad six beat scrolling Twitter or threads or even reading articles on medium or something on Kindle I really enjoyed the form factor and it was very comfortable to hold on even for long reading sessions it's an 11 inch 144hz display thereby making it super smooth the viewing experience is thereby really nice you can binge watch your favorite Netflix shows for hours although I don't recommend that you do that speaking of ours it really has a great battery life no cap I was out for a couple of days and it kept lying down in my drawer when I came back after two days I was really amazed because it still had 90 of battery left xiaomi was somehow able to manage the idle time really nicely it's also for the fact that it has a gigantic 8840 mAh battery I was able to get about six to seven hours of screen on time on single charge while actively using it I kept playing Asphalt 9 and Rand geekbench 6 again and again in order to test it out these were the geekbench scores by the way for somewhat of a moderate usage it can actually last more than an entire day to be honest out of the box it's running on Android 13 with the MIUI skin on top of it xiaomi has taken every single measure they can in order to make the pad 6 feel like the iPad when you unlock the tab it clearly looks similar to iPad take a close look at the icons all the apps have been adjusted to the infamous rounded rectangles rather the default wallpaper was also very similar MIUI like always has a bit of bloatware and unnecessary apps that you'll never use the dock was actually really convenient it slides up very smoothly you can just drag and drop apps from the dock to start the split screen multitasking you can even add shortcuts to your frequently used multitask windows so that's really neat out there I was able to take handwritten notes while reading articles on medium it ran smoothly and I faced no lag or any such issues one thing I like to point out is that the type C Port is actually a USB 3.2 Port you can transfer files real smooth and it will definitely be a lot more faster it has Dolby Atmos and a total of four speakers two at the top and two at the bottom the sound was balanced it artificially did not increase the highs like most other tablets do I even did some good amount of gaming as well I mostly played Asphalt 9 and beach buggy racing and a little bit of Minecraft by the way the Snapdragon 870 chip was able to handle that very well and to be honest it didn't have much heating issues xiaomi actually has a record of heating devices so I was surprised to see this if you are planning to take selfies using the patch 6 my advice for you is please don't take selfies the front camera is an absolute potato potato if you were planning to attend meetings or even your online classes using this although the positioning of the front camera was ideal for doing video calls as it was on the horizontal bezel but sadly it just wasn't there I'll let you decide for yourself so this is my front camera footage when I'm actually standing next to my softbox and my setup but when I just move across the room you can already see a lot of grains happening everywhere and yeah I don't recommend that you use your front camera much to record videos first it's gonna give you very average results to be honest the back camera was however reasonable so this is how the back camera looks in daylight it's good enough to be honest and if you have a well-lit environment this can actually give you some decent results I'm currently recording our 4K 30 FPS I obviously did not expect it to have a flagship level camera but yeah it did a great job considering it's just a tablet and people mostly won't be using it to take photos maybe a few scans or some random snaps overall if you want to click a photo randomly then you'll be able to get some okay results using this it's a 13 megapixel camera by the way now let's talk about the xiaomi smart pin the pen was actually very pricey in comparison so I was really curious about it first things first the pen really has a great battery life I haven't seen it below 99 percent even for once the pen has two physical buttons one opens up the quick note section and the other one opens up the screenshot utility you will be able to select the region you want to take a snapshot of it also snaps magnetically on the side of the tab not the best one though it kept falling even with the slightest touch this was really disappointing as I dropped my smart pen a lot of times multiple times and a lot of times and multiple times this is how it stands compared to the apple pencil the apple pencil is a teeny bit taller and also has a broader tip compared to the xiaomi smart pen the writing experience was nice actually the pressure sensitivity feels a bit weird since I've switched from the apple pencil you just need to get used to it to be honest if you're gonna use a pen like stylus for the first time then you won't face any issue you can get used to it quite comfortably the riding experience was great overall I did not face any issues while taking notes it was a rather smooth experience but I did not like the writing experience on the default Notes app of the xiaomi pad 6. it really felt slow and stuttery it was like a cheap replica of Apple notes to be honest for this one I was actually using this really cool app called Nebo I also tried out some digital art I was sketching some random comics and doodles I actually liked how it felt overall was really comfortable and I did not miss my apple pencil at all for the price I can highly recommend it if you want to get started doing digital art xiaomi also claims that the xiaomi pen charges from 0 to 100 in just 18 minutes you can also attach a keyboard at the back using the magnetic pins I only got the xiaomi pen I'll leave a link of the keyboard as well in case you might be interested in that and I almost forgot to mention you get a 33 watt charger right out of the box this was a actually after a while that I purchased something and I got a charger along with it let's talk about the price now it cost 26 triple nine in India and US pricing is about 400 the smart pen however cost five triple nine in India and I'm not really sure about the US pricing because it's not available on Amazon us at this moment while I was recording this video but I read an article somewhere that it costs around 130 US dollars if you want to buy the pad 6 I highly recommend that you get it you probably won't get a better Android tablet in this price point if you want to buy the pen as well it will cost you a total of 530 US dollars so that's something you must think about well if you ask me I feel that the price could have been a little bit lower selling with the price of the pad six it is what it is but if you plan to buy it then please go ahead as I really like the performance so is the xiaomi pad 6 really an iPad on a budget in many ways yes it offers a solid performance and a great display and has a Sleek design all of these at a fraction of a price of the iPad if you are looking for a budget friendly Android tablet that does not compromise on performance then the xiaomi path 6 is definitely worth considering do let me know your thoughts in the comments and if you wanted to check out the best and Road apps that would help you stay productive then click here please consider subscribing to my channel and I hope to see you there [Music] baby when you look at methe number one selling foreign shall I remind you we give you valuable products budgeting for example me pad five Snapdragon 860. 120 hertz in the display committee aspects career um foreign foreign foreign as you guys know this is xiaomi pad six uh one of the latest item from xiaomi pads and I would want to say that this is one of the best product xiaomi have ever put out in India foreign so this is definitely a good uh item and yeah and I think that they have changed ladies and gentlemen so let's just unbox this is produced 33 watts in the charger type A to type 0 power delivery so we have the xiaomi pad six Snapdragon 870 up to 3.2 gigahertz in uh who protect your consumer right keep this label intact okay um ladies and gentlemen this is xiaomi pad 6. so let's just look at it this is foreign foreign great thing actually let's check the sound quality comparing to the other tab but uh speakers [Applause] so yeah good speaker very nice vibrant display uh 144 Hertz on a very smooth case foreign back face is xiaomi pad 6 keyboard yes stand like this oh minute I PM so multitasking is split screen so Snapdragon day 870 chips we have one more thing oh previous generations tap to connect tutorial screenshot press and hold the screenshot button to take and edit a screenshot oh nice you can literally use this to navigate foreign [Laughter] you can do this you can select and you can draw it this is one of the best especially sensitive but still foreign but xiaomi paddling navigation menu this is a basic thing you should do with something like this foreign I don't know screenshots on an emergency situation tablet really works and this is a powerful tablet eight seven years so performance it will be really nice in this product is another video so till then I think this is definitely a good product from xiaomi oh by the way very important yes you know that is actually a great thing for 128 you are getting this for 27 000 icic card online discount so 23 000 oh my God for that price this is gone uh shortcuts definitely a good upgrade from the last year previous generation xiaomi is going to rule again and you get a proper tab UI and everything so face ID face unlock very good display uh but very good display 144 Hertz mighty one plus some one for 144 hertzana and I already benefit for OnePlus is 67 watts in a fast charging you know 33 Watts on window but other than that I think for the price this product is awesome foreign [Laughter]so OnePlus made a tablet and I made a quick short explaining it and immediately there are a bunch of comments like oh please this is worth a full video please make a full video on this please elaborate on this so now that's what I'm doing so I really get to explain what they've done see tablets haven't really changed much over the past couple years feels like we've kind of settled if you will into this sort of hierarchy where especially in the US iPads are so popular that it's basically just iPads and everything else and I've even had conversations recently with some friends about this which is just like they straight up won't switch from the iPad like no matter how good of a competitor comes up it can be amazing Hardware it can be the best screen the best battery in the world it's an amazing tablet but it still wouldn't be an iPad which is the iMessage and the FaceTime and all the things that plug into the ecosystem of iPad and apple world so making an Android tablet that can actually take users from the iPad is clearly an uphill battle but hey if you're gonna try you might as well have some strategy to it and so OnePlus has three so strategy number one copying the iPad so look just to be clear I understand there's only so many ways to make a rectangular computer there's only so many ways to make a tablet uh and I actually don't mind when products copy each other as long as they copy the good stuff that being said yeah they've ripped some stuff straight from the iPad now it does have its own unique Hardware aesthetic you got to give them that it's a different shape and a different color and of course it's a different layout with a bunch of OnePlus and Android features that really suggest more holding it in landscape unlike the iPads which feel a bit more interchangeable but they weren't shy about some things like this pencil this is the apple pencil and this is the new OnePlus pencil same shape same size same pressure sensitive tip which is nice same single flat side which prevents it from Rolling away on a table which is smart but then same slapping onto the side of a tablet with magnets and charging it by inductive wireless charging so you don't lose it it's convenient it even has the same little animation to show you when you've paired it and how much battery percentage you have there are probably other ways to do this but you know the result is just a very familiar experience with a nice finely controlled pressure sensitive pointing device for navigating around and swiping and even typing and of course all the drawing and note taking you possibly want they've also made a magnetic keyboard accessory with a trackpad that can connects to the tablet with magnets and these pins and turns it into a whole lappable Android 11 inch laptop alternative it might not completely float the tablet above the keyboard like the heavier less lappable one from Apple but it does use basically the exact same cursor mechanism as the iPad where you can swipe around with this dark circle and then it snaps onto different touch targets As you move near them again a pretty great thing to copy it's got quad speakers in the same four spots as the iPad Pro it's even got this Ultra wide camera at the front that has a software feature that can move around as you walk around and keep you in the center of the frame it's not called Center Stage though it's called Limelight the point is there's a ton of stuff here where if you're going to take people away from the iPad you gotta at least make them feel at home so then strategy number two undercutting the iPad this one's pretty simple the iPad line is already pretty expensive so probably the most compelling thing you can do to get someone to consider an alternative is to be cheaper than the iPad so iPad Air I think that's a pretty good comp iPad Air starts right now with the newest one at 5.99 and that's the 64 gig version this tablet as we mentioned pretty fairly priced 479 and that's 128 gig so you can see it's a pretty good start but you have to be careful because in order to get to that price you have to trim just the right set of things that people hopefully don't notice too much so this tablet is running a mediatek demensity 9000 chip which benchmarks similar to the Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 which is about 50 beneath the more expensive Flagship Snapdragon 8 gen 2. honestly most of the time not noticeable but if you are going to ask it some more demanding things especially like gaming then you will feel that this is not the highest end chip there is also no fingerprint reader which is fine but there's also no extra infrared or depth sensors it's just straight up facial recognition with the standard RGB selfie camera and for some reason my face has to be really close to it to unlock it's just picky enough to get slightly annoying sometimes and then this display doesn't quite get as bright it maxes out at 500 nits so it limits your outdoor usability for sure and then this keyboard case which is optional it's actually noticeably cheaper than Apples too it's actually 149 so it's literally half the price of the magic keyboard but also it's not back lit it doesn't float the tablet or anything it's also less premium feeling material so it's more in line with the smart folio case which is still 179 but really the most interesting strategy strategy number three is one-upping the iPad there are some things they've done with this tablet that are objectively better than any iPad okay so here we go first of all this is an 11.5 inch display with a unique slightly tall seven by five aspect ratio and slightly thinner bezels on the iPad but you know what's straight up better than any iPad it's 144 Hertz refresh rate granted that's only slightly higher than 120 hertz iPad Pro but for 479 I mean you're more in line with the 60 hertz iPad Air and I'm a sucker for a high refresh rate display and I do notice the difference in a few key places like scrolling around browsing in Chrome and drawing with the pen but more on that in a second the ultra wide front facing camera is on the landscape bezel that's also better than almost every iPad except for the newest cheap one so anytime you're on a video call you actually sit in the middle of the frame not kind of awkwardly off to one side it also is an objectively better battery than any iPad this is a 9 500 10 milliamp hour battery that's iPad Pro sized and combined with the chip has Rock Solid battery life and very good standby time and it charges much faster than any iPad it's got 67 watt supervook charging so most of the tablet using world is going to be used to the iPad's kind of slow 30 watts of charging this one can charge from zero to 100 in an hour and a half with the charger that's included in the box and then there's also this whole special features section in the settings where they've tucked these nice clever little enhancements mostly to do with the multitasking experience so I'm not even going to remind you of the disaster that is stage manager on the iPad that's still kind of rough but on the OnePlus pad you can do things like drag two fingers down from the middle of the screen to slice your app in half and initiate split screen multitasking with apps that support it and then there's three different window sizes that it supports and you can switch those around there's also a smart side bar that kind of slides out from the top right where it's this hidden dock so you can put your favorite apps in there or some quick shortcuts to grab whatever you want or just open up the list of all your apps again so lots of good stuff in here right even they've even got some little ecosystem stuff going on since OnePlus makes phones you can do data sharing with another OnePlus phone super easily there's a lot but this is still an Android tablet which means a lot of things it means of course that there is no FaceTime iMessage all the ecosystem stuff that comes that Apple people like obviously but that also means the app situation is still not what you want it to be like when I say apps that support it with multitasking that's a pretty small list like there's just very few good well-optimized Android tablet apps even today in 2023 it also means that the 144hz capable display is rarely actually uh refreshing at 144hz it's often at 120 hertz or even 60 hertz depending on the app support again uh and that sort of means you only really get the extra stuff when you're scrolling around the UI or web browsing or in the settings app basically and not while gaming it also means the cameras are meh so you see the the camera is sort of in this unique layout in the middle it's a 13 megapixel camera on the back but the photos it takes are pretty mid not that a tablet is like some photography machine it's mostly for video calls but even this is pretty grainy it has this like splotching even in a well-lit environment not great and then for the arguably even more important selfie camera it's it's mostly for video calls and so it should look pretty decent this is perfect lighting and even in these dark shadows you can see some weird noise artifacts and splotching and and this over here it it's 1080P and it's it's fine it's probably fine but in Limelight mode when it's doing the ultra wide and hunting around it looks worse than this too and it also means that Android 14 is on the horizon so that will probably improve a lot of the multitasking stuff we just saw but this one's going to launch with Android 13. so if you get one it'll have Android 13 and never buy a product based on potential future software updates so as of right now it's an Android 13 tablet so OnePlus has made a good tablet for a good price I think a lot of people consider this a bargain f479 for the 128 gigs but because of this data tablets it feels like they're up against some impossible task like this is the same thing that happened to Samsung's Ultra tablet remember the video I made on the ultra the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra tried something super super high end and honestly in the hardware and design department they really beat the iPad in a lot of ways they made an incredible piece but same question where is it now I think the same place as this some people are going to buy it and they're going to be pretty happy with it and those people knew exactly what they were getting into and it's a tough task taking tablet buyers from the iPad thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] foreign [Music]
