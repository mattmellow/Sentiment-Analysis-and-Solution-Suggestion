This is a perfect tablet, before i was going for tab s7+ for 45k, but now i think i was stupid, when i got mi tab 6 in 22k, nothing can beat the value i get from this. i can not even imagine why anyone with basic needs will want anything else. a perfect tablet. the only thing is i cant comment on its longetivity for now, but still, a tab for 22k? even if it lasts 2-3 years i could buy it again and again and keep it fresh. though the processor is strong and i think it will easily last for 4-5 years>>><<<Can I exchange mi pad 5 with mi pad 6 ?>>><<<I&#39;m planning to buy for my online classes and mainly for studying.

Thats really the only reason i didnt buy one.>>><<<Regarding the words at the beginning I can attest. I have a friend who is full on Android. Hates Apple to the core. But he still uses an iPad for a tablet because the competition is just not there.<br>To me, this tablet is a step closer if not just because of the aspect ratio. I never realized how ideal the ratio is on iPads until I picked up a Galaxy tab. So awkward to hold that standard 16:9.>>><<<Quando compara iPad com o top da concorrência, a maçã perde em custo benefício.

It’s the goat and the king of tablets.>>><<<As much as i love an iPad, the thing that really annoys me is that there is no multiple users feature like on Android. It really is just designed for 1 individual. <br><br>In my household, none of us need a tablet enough to warrant a tablet each, but we do like a single tablet laying around in the living room should you need it. Having multiple users ability on android just makes it easier for all your own accounts to be signed in instantly, such as emails, photos, etc for quick access. And should someone else want to use it after, they have their own profile and all their settings, apps etc saved.>>><<<Need a iPad Mini competitor pleeeeeaaaaseeeee>>><<<Poor man’s iPad lol>>><<<Clone>>><<<They should of allowed user replacable battery, and they should of never got rid of the finger print scanner.<br><br>In the UK you can only buy the 128gb version, 128gb in 2024 with no expandable storage?

Apple is being sued for having a monopoly! Their iphone and ipad are not just original products but best in class... their hardware and software is 12 years ahead of any tech company.. this is a fact.>>><<<I think it&#39;s both an ipad killer and a clone.>>><<<Now that the smallest model Galaxy Tab S has an OLED, it’s easily the best android tablet on the market. My entire tech ecosystem is Apple, but they didn’t have a OLED iPad, so I went with the Galaxy and I’m so glad I did. It definitely filled the void left behind after my Note 20 Ultra broke.>>>
