one to future proof it since its literally just 15 euros more But anw do you think it would ve good enough to edit raw photos on it with Lightroom and similar apps Mostly asking for the render time overall performance the display color accuracy and sharpness >>><<< Im searching for a secondary tablet for streaming YouTube Netflix DisneyPlus Prime Video etc and for reading ebooks The one Im currently using is kinda overkill for that so I was thinking of downgrading a bit Which would be better for that among this Redmi Pad the Realme Pad and the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite I already tried the

in the browser >>><<< Cool reviews thanks >>><<< Not a bad tablet Competitor Lenovo 2022 But 2024 is better and cheaper And the Xiaomi branded stylus costs an incredible amount of money And for Lenovo the original stylus is 2 thousand >>><<< How is it different from Redmi Pad >>><<< Thanks for the advice youre great >>><<< How many gadgets has he dropped already >>><<< I got friezes in my head when

return to the previous page I cant find any button or acronym Thank you in advance Nath >>><<< Cool >>><<< Well hello I just got the exact same tablet except I didnt quite get the multifunction mode with the floating windows Thank you for a response have a good day >>><<< I thank you for the good and detailed presentation of this video This tablet only interests me I have two questions to ask you First can you tell me if this tablet is compatible with HiFi sound Res so that I can listen to streaming music with Qobuz I obviously have headphones compatible with highresolution sound I saw that the tablet had a 35 jack socket although that is not the case in any case I can also send it via bluetooth My second question I would like to know if there is a lot of Bloatware on it as on their mobile phone I find it very restrictive I thank you in advance if you can give me answers to these questions See you JMC 13 >>><<< As long as you can stream properly with it that would be completely enough for me I dont need a tablet that costs euros500 or something >>><<< Would that be something for students or not >>><<< Is it worth switching from a Samsung a6 585 model from 2016 Widelive Level L3 >>><<< When I read reviews of such devices I always ask myself WHY would someone consume media Spend euros200 on an 11 inch tablet that can easily fall For the same price there is a 32inch smart TV eg for the childrens room or a refurbished Professional laptop with 14 or 156 inches that has x ports and is also great to use both brands And if there is a tablet for the kitchen should be one with T606 will do for half the price All three devices just mentioned do their job well in my household >>><<< Ive been using the tablet for a few days Complementary to desktop PC and smartphone Absolutely ok for my purposes Satisfied for under euros200 But Xiaomi customer service is uninformed If you dont dare to practice and try this device will sell quickly Information from the manufacturer is poor Seniors should book a VHS course immediately >>><<< And how long does it take to get updates >>><<< I use the Honor Pad x9 with 120Hz and 6 speakers for the same price great >>><<< I have A few months ago I treated myself to a 141inch tablet Nameless brand for 230 euros in a Chinese shop now under 200 euros The joy was shortlived Losing every word about it is a waste Its just crap in every respect Can be found on Amazon for 291 euros I was seduced by the size >>><<< I ordered the 4GB Redmi Pad today for euros149 we need it as a replacement for the TV in the kitchen I hope you think it will be enough for that >>><<< I mean I get the tablet for free since I got the Xiaomi 13 T so I cant complain >>><<< If you could get the tab for 50 euros less it would be a real nobrainer Thats like the Fire HD 10 for 80 euros The price is the deciding factor As a living room tablet for couch surfing streaming social media and light games it is easily sufficient But 200 euros is a bit too much for me personally >>><<< We bought the Remi Pad SE with 6 GB of RAM for around 200 euros and I cant confirm the performance statement We use this tablet in our bathroom as a media tablet with family software on it that recognizes who is currently logging in with which password and then opens the corresponding interface The tablet is more than enough for all social media YouTube games or even one or two emails and the thing doesnt have to be able to do anything more For those who are now triggered because we use it as a tablet in the bathroom still better than reading the newspaper Great video thanks for that >>><<< At first I wanted to buy the SE but then I stumbled across the normal Redmi Pad 4128 for the same price and bought that Advantages are the more powerful SoC Helio G99 also made in 6nm especially in the graphics area The internal memory is also faster because you get a UFS 22 connection With this SoC I can also play somewhat more complex games Dead Cells Honkai Star Rail and the memory connection is much faster with readingwriting at the same time Otherwise the two tablets dont have much in common One has a 35mm jack connection the other has a slightly better battery life But it is the advantages mentioned above that for me are the decisive reasons for the NONSE >>><<< I have the normal Redmi Pad and am absolutely satisfied Use it for streaming and social media Its absolutely enough for that >>><<< In the price range up to 200 euros there is usually not much more power 60 Hz and possibly LTE if you want more you have to pay more 300400 euros Xiaomi pad 5 or 6 Oneplus pad etc >>><<< If theoretically my daughter had needed a new tablet I might have taken a look at it but for us adults I would prefer to use Xiaomi >>><<< I got an original iPad 9th generation for euros200 on Black Friday >>><<< Nice >>><<< Everything in excellent condition >>><<< I love this tablet and the quality of audio is great >>><<< For me its better than another more recognized brand >>><<< I bought this tablet for my husband He like it but the resolution of screen is not vivid as my Samsung S2 The pro is the tablet is very light weight fast speed good for watching YT or movie from app and it has Netfix >>><<< This tab is exactly what my better half needed And for the money its a winwin >>><<< Very good team >>><<< Good value for the price Works great >>><<< GOOD >>><<< It does not come with a case or protection for the screen the >>><<< Its exactly as it looks like >>><<< It arrived in Peru super fast and arrived in perfect condition it arrived just like the description Good product >>><<< I bought this as a present for my parents All they do is youtube and Netflix and they absolutely love it they love how big the screen is they said its nice and bright with beautiful colours and very loud very good for mom to listen to youtube while she cooks or preps ingrediants They used to have a Samsung Note Tablet 101 inch so it was a very old tablet they upgraded from >>><<< Excellent quality price >>><<< I use it for surfing and it is completely sufficient Display and battery are very nice Also good Xiaomi quality >>><<< On the hardware side you cant complain plenty of RAM and storage The display is also good as is the sound Of course when it comes to advertising promises about gaming you have to make some compromises with everything that is 3D the graphics processor struggles solely with the very high screen resolution even with reduced rendering resolution and many graphics options at minimum somewhat complex Android systems run Title pixelated or with a few images per second It would be good to expect too much for the little money The own Android version still MIUI Pad Global currently 1405 is something very special to me You spend a long time looking for some options because they are simply somewhere else than on the standard Android Or not exist at all Some gestures are also very unique its easy to switch off But especially with such a large device 11 and 256GB of memory it would be nice if several family members could have their own Google accounts on the device But there is only the second profile which unfortunately doesnt work so well for additional children Unfortunately Xiaomi doesnt offer limited profiles like Samsungs which means its not a good tablet for families with children >>><<< Works great battery lasts a long time lets see how long that lasts >>><<< Fast but above all excellent video and audio >>><<< Very good value for money >>><<< large tablet The only negative point is MIUI 14 absence of HOME button and photo previews displayed in low resolution in Gallery Minimum settings essential Good sound quite powerful >>><<< I liked it a lot It is extremely functional I recommend it >>><<< I find it functional and practical It has good definition and I can see my messages well >>><<< The picture is really incredibly good At the beginning it is made clear how to operate it The circle and square at the bottom will no longer be visible However updating the Apps themselves does not happen automatically And Aptx is really great if you have equipment that can receive this Bluetooth NO AUDIOVIDEO from USBC a USBC hub is not an option for TV or DAC >>><<< Good tablet for a mediumlow range It doesnt seem subject to excessive heating In subsequent models the camera a little more would be enough for much better photos and the display need improvement Otherwise the performance is good even in split screen and with floating windows open >>><<< Unfortunately the price collapsed after a few weeks so that a better tablet from the Xiaomi brand could have been obtained for slightly more money >>><<< Money well spent Top quality >>><<< Purchase without problem >>><<< What is specified is fulfilled At first I thought that due to the cost perhaps they sent another device with a different storage capacity but once I had it at home I verified that it was as is It arrived in perfect condition includes tablet USB cable and charger Takes photos and videos well It has 4 speakers which sounds perfect Easy practical and simple movement I can read in it watch videos see my graphs it is excellent very satisfied with the purchase >>><<< Ordering and delivery worked great it was easy to set up even if you dont know much about it We use it to read the newspaper It has a nice image resolution so far we are very happy with it >>><<< Fast and reliable beautiful recommended design >>><<< It has been a very successful purchase Very light tablet fast and easy to operate >>><<< Perfect very happy >>><<< Really very disappointed Bought to specifically play certain games requiring GPS and the tablet contains no GPS chip An element that would perhaps be essential to point out in the description >>><<< The truth is that I was very surprised by the price I got it for It works very well for playing basic games the same for watching streaming or even for writing documents good battery performance I was surprised by how long the battery lasts which sometimes exasperates me because it takes more than an hour to charge to 100percent >>><<< At a low price lots of power Fast essential the battery has a remarkable life The screen is very sensitive but its a matter of getting used to it Sharp screen I dont have great needs but I can do what I have to do excellently >>><<< Excellent Tablet for the price it works great its battery consumption is very low and I never turn it off it holds up to work with good performance I guess the extra RAM helps it a lot The brightness of the screen is good the sound too I dont use it for games I use it for office automation and networks it has a wired headphone output which for me is the best although it is Bluetooth it works wonderfully >>><<< I bought it as a gift it comes perfectly packaged everything is fine at first glance >>><<< Quite useful for classes >>><<< Excellent pricequality ratio >>><<< I didnt look at the size and its bigger than I wanted but it works super well clear graphics excellent audio fluid so far so good >>><<< I liked that it doesnt jam everything runs very smoothly >>><<< About the seller He sent the product well packaged everything was correct and the invoice arrived in the email Delivery I placed the order on a Friday night and on Tuesday the product was already at my house About the Tablet SENSATIONAL I used it before and then came to evaluate it The battery has incredible durability 4 sound outputs it looks like a speaker the image is perfect and the system is super fast It has many functions I was on the fence between this one and the Samsung one but I dont regret it I chose the green color its a very soft and beautiful tone I hope I helped >>><<< Exceeded all my expectations >>><<< I loved it very good >>><<< Im going to make this review as I tried to find information when I was looking for a tablet I needed something to study so due to the configurations this tablet perfectly meets my needs I looked for the version with 8GB of RAM so it would be faster One piece of information that I find useful and that I hadnt seen before is that it has a split screen function so I can use YouTube and a writing app or other content at the same time I even added an image This makes it much easier for those who like to take notes The sound on this tablet is wonderful due to the four outputs and the screen also surprised me with its quality I made an excellent purchase Furthermore upon arriving in Brazil it was taxed and the seller promptly paid the fee very quickly >>><<< ok >>><<< I bought this tablet to use for studies and so far it has been perfect the customs fee was paid by the seller the delivery was good and I am very happy with my purchase >>><<< I bought the tablet on 0215 and it was delivered on 0304 in perfect condition I was charged Rdollar 6023 I paid the fee but sent the receipt to the seller who refunded the amount within 2 days on the card invoice and was very attentive in answering questions As for the tablet its very fast and doesnt crash Its very worth it >>><<< I loved the product it arrived within 22 days the tablet was taxed but the seller paid for everything correctly >>><<< I bought it for basic things and it works perfectly >>><<< It arrived exactly it took a week and a half to arrive I really liked it it was fluid Im still learning but I already love it >>><<< It arrived in perfect condition Ive had it for almost a month and I havent had any problems >>><<< Play Video The product arrived

Its really worth it better than I expected >>><<< It is not approved by Anatel Theres a noise in the camera as if something had come loose It feels empty inside like hollow Did not like It slows down a bit the most demanding should look for a more advanced processor >>><<< It is an issue to be able to talk to the seller he does not give solutions and ignores the problem Do I recommend Xiaomi obviously yes Do I recommend the seller There are other options >>><<< Tablet is beautiful it was working normally until one day when turning on the device it turned on only half of the screen worked the other half turned on with a defect as shown in the photos and good video we were actually satisfied with the xiaomi tablet unfortunately it didnt last 1 month of use We took all the precautions we
